"SK Telecom, Singtel to develop tools to ease 6G transition","SK Telecom, Singtel to develop tools to ease 6G transition","SK Telecom and Singtel are developing AI and orchestration technologies required to pave the way for telcos to easily transition to 6G

SK Telecom was one of the earliest operators to launch 5G in 2018

The South Korean telco is forging ahead in AI, most recently with a $200 million investment in Smart Global Holdings (SGH)

South Korea’s SK Telecom and Singapore’s Singtel have signed a two-year Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to use artificial intelligence (AI) and orchestration tools and strengthen their knowledge and expertise of new technologies, like network virtualization, required to transition to 6G.

“The partners will also work together on developing differentiated, innovative solutions to elevate their network capabilities, such as Edge-AI infrastructure, which reduces computational burden concentrated on the cloud through edge computing and performs AI inference by combining AI solutions,” a press release about the partnership stated.

The initiative will help the two service providers improve connectivity, provide AI offerings to customers, and enhance customer experience by enabling them to restore services quickly.

SK Telecom and Singtel will also jointly develop a whitepaper on their progress in areas such as virtualization, slicing and network evolution, which they believe will help other service providers benefit from 5G’s capabilities and prepare for 6G.

6G and AI investments abound

SK Telecom released a whitepaper last year to present the key requirements for 6G standardization. It was also one of the earliest operators to launch 5G in 2018.

Separately, SK Telecom invested $200 million in Smart Global Holdings (SGH), an integrated data center solution provider, to offer new services to its customers. This is one of the largest artificial intelligence (AI) investments SK Telecom has made in an AI company to advance in the global AI infrastructure market.

""By combining the strengths of both companies, we aim to achieve efficient, high-performance network construction, enhance network stability, and discover new network-based services,"" said Kang Jong-ryeol, head of ICT infra at SK Telecom. ""Additionally, we will strive to make significant advancements in next-generation communication technologies, including AI-powered wired and wireless infrastructure.""

Tay Yeow Lian, managing director of networks at Singtel, added, “As a global leader in 5G technology, we’re keen to capitalize on the myriad capabilities this technology has to offer, especially in the areas of network slicing and with the inclusion of AI.""

Singtel is ""looking to not only enhance the experience of our customers but also to drive industry innovation and help us prepare for the evolution to 6G,” Tay said.

Growing profile of Asian telcos

SK Telecom and Singtel are also members of the Global Telco AI Alliance, which was announced earlier this year, to leverage AI to expedite the transformation of the existing telcos’ business and to develop new AI-powered business models. The organization is also developing multilingual large language models (LLMs) for telecom service providers. Other members of the Global Telco AI Alliance include Deutsche Telekom, Softbank and e&.

Increasingly, Asian telcos, like SK Telecom, are playing a crucial role in the development of new communications technology and standardization. Now, with 6G, the telcos are aiming to grow their profile as technology leaders in the telecom space.

South Korea is also focusing on 6G technology, and recently, the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) has set a target of 2028 for the launch of 6G. This is two years before the expected launch of 6G globally.

Similarly, the Singapore Government’s Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) recently collaborated with the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) to launch the Future Communications Connectivity (FCC) lab with a focus on 6G.",https://www.fierce-network.com/wireless/sk-telecom-singtel-develop-tools-ease-6g-transition,"SK Telecom and Singtel are developing AI and orchestration technologies

SK Telecom pumps $200m into AI factory builder,SK Telecom pumps $200m into AI factory builder,"In its latest move to position itself as an AI company, South Korean telco SK Telecom has announced a $200m investment in Smart Global Holdings (SGH), a California-based company that designs, builds and manages high-performance computing systems that are used for AI workloads.

SGH has a number of different technology development and design business lines, including memory and storage solutions and LED (light emitting diode) chips and components. But its Intelligent Platform Solutions division, which generates about half of its annual $1.2bn revenues, is focused on building, deploying and managing high-performance computing, AI and internet of things (IoT) systems and services tailored to the specific needs of its enterprise customers, which can be deployed in the cloud or at private edge facilities. It will come as no surprise, then, that SGH counts AI chip giant Nvidia among its key partners.

SK Telecom believes SGH complements its other AI activities, including its investments and partnerships with the likes of generative AI (GenAI) large language model developer Anthropic and GenAI search developer Perplexity, and plans to work closely with the US firm to develop “differentiated global end-to-end AI factory and datacentre solutions and services, advanced memory market products and services, and NPU-based AI edge servers.” (An NPU is a neural processing unit, otherwise known as an AI accelerator.)

The companies plan to enter into a collaboration this year “with an emphasis on establishing a more concrete cooperation across the AI infrastructure business, including AI datacentre, edge AI, and future memory solutions,” noted SK Telecom in its announcement about the investment. The South Korean company believes the SGH relationship will “solidify [its] position in the AI value chain across the three pillars: AI semiconductor, AI infrastructure and AI services.”

SKT will invest $200m in SGH by acquiring 200,000 preferred shares: Those shares are convertible into ordinary SGH shares at a conversion price of $32.81 per preferred share. SGH’s share price currently stands at $29.35, having risen by about 1.5% on Monday following the news of SKT’s investment. SGH says the new capital will give it greater financial flexibility as it expands the scope and scale of its “end-to-end AI factory offerings”, which it takes to market using the brand Penguin Solutions.

“SGH and Penguin Solutions have a proven methodology to deploy their AI infrastructure solutions at some of the most innovative and demanding large-scale enterprise customers in the world,” stated SK Telecom CEO Ryu Young-sang. “Our investment in and cooperation with SGH will give us an opportunity to boost our position in the AI value chain. In the era of AI transformation, we plan to continue to collaborate and make proactive investments to achieve global leadership in AI,” added the CEO.

SGH is equally pleased, of course. “We are thrilled to have SKT as a strategic investor,” stated Mark Adams, CEO of SGH. “Today’s announcement is a testament to Penguin Solutions’ capabilities in the deployment of AI factories at scale through our systems, software, and managed services suite of solutions. We look forward to executing on these strategic collaboration opportunities with the SKT team and believe they will create value for our respective stakeholders.”

In its most recent financial quarter (for the three months to 31 May), SGH reported revenues of almost $301m, down more than 12% year on year, and an operating profit of $11.5m compared with a small loss a year earlier.

SK Telecom accelerates AI push via alliance with more partners,SK Telecom accelerates AI push via alliance with more partners,"SK Telecom Co., South Korea’s top mobile carrier, is accelerating its artificial intelligence push by luring more domestic partners into its AI alliance to better compete with global Big Tech companies.

Last week, the K-AI Alliance, an SK Telecom-led Korean AI group, held Unite 2024, its annual gathering, in Silicon Valley, where the telecom company said it is opening up its alliance wider to attract more local AI companies into its fold.

The alliance launched in February 2023 and was led by SK Telecom in partnership with seven AI startups – Phantom AI, Sapeon, Bespin Global, Moloco, Konan Technology, Sweet Technologies and Tuat.

At this year’s Unite event, the alliance welcomed two new Korean members – GPU and AI computing platform operator Lablup and media-specialized AI firm XL8, raising the number of its member companies to 18.

“You alone cannot keep up with the pace of AI innovation. Cooperation is essential to survival in this field. With our strengthened alliance, we will show the world the strength of the Korean AI power,” said SK Telecom Chief Executive Ryu Young-sang.

In July 2023, the company joined forces with three global peers – Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. (SingTel), Deutsche Telekom and the United Arab Emirates’ e& – to launch a global AI group, the Global Telco AI Alliance (GTAA).

The alliance boasting a combined user base of 1.3 billion people worldwide, became bigger this February, joined by Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp.

The five partners recently set up a joint venture to develop a large language model (LLM) tailored to the needs of telecommunication companies.

The companies plan to create multinational LLMs that support various languages starting with English, Korean, Japanese, German and Arabic.

Just a couple of years ago, SK Telecom pursued AI technology development in-house but recently changed its policy to grow via partnerships with other AI firms.

Chicago, IL – June 25, 2024 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses SK Telecom Co., Ltd. SKM, KT Corp. KT and Ceragon Networks Ltd. CRNT.

Industry: Wireless - International

Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2292206/3-wireless-non-us-stocks-to-buy-despite-industry-challenges

The Zacks Wireless Non-US industry appears to be mired in high capital expenditure for infrastructure upgrades, margin erosion, supply-chain disruptions due to geopolitical conflicts, raging wars and high customer inventory levels. However, healthy demand trends stemming from the increasing propensity to stay connected in this digital age should benefit the industry in the long run.

SK Telecom Co., Ltd., KT Corp. and Ceragon Networks Ltd. are likely to capitalize on the rising demand for scalable infrastructure for seamless connectivity of wireless and fiber networks, with the wide proliferation of IoT and accelerated 5G deployment.

Industry Description

The Zacks Wireless Non-US industry comprises mobile telecommunications and broadband service providers based on foreign shores. These companies primarily offer voice services, including local, domestic and international calls, roaming services, and prepaid and postpaid services.

The firms provide value-added services, such as the IoT, comprising logistics and fleet management, and automotive and health solutions. They also offer content streaming, interactive applications, wireless security services and mobile payment solutions.

Some industry players sell mobile handsets and accessories through dealer networks and offer co-billing services to other telecommunications service providers. The firms provide IT solutions, cable and satellite pay television subscriptions, as well as data services and hosting services, to residential and corporate clients.

What's Shaping the Future of Wireless Non-US Industry?

Demand Erosion for Legacy Services: Increased infrastructure spending for network upgrades has largely compromised short-term margins. Aggressive promotional expenses, lucrative discounts and the adoption of several low-priced service plans to attract and retain customers are eroding profits. A steady decline in linear TV subscribers and legacy services due to a challenging macroeconomic environment and high inflation adds to the margin woes.

Consequently, the firms within the industry are increasingly seeking diversification from legacy telecom services to more business, enterprise and wholesale opportunities. The companies are making significant investments to upgrade their network and product portfolio, including considerable advances in software-defined, wide-area network capabilities and a new Cloud Core architecture.

Story continues

Network Convergence: The convergence of network technologies requires considerable investments from traditional carriers (telecom and cable) and cloud service providers. With the exponential growth of mobile broadband traffic and home Internet solutions, user demand for coverage speed and quality has increased manifold. This has resulted in a massive demand for advanced networking architecture, forcing service providers to upgrade their networks to support the surge in home data traffic.

The industry participants continue to invest in networks to increase coverage and implement new technologies to optimize network capabilities. Further, there is a continuous need for network tuning and optimization to maintain superior performance standards, creating demand for state-of-the-art wireless products and services.

Moreover, telecom services show a weak correlation to macroeconomic factors as these are considered necessities. This, in turn, has led the carriers to focus more on network upgrades to cater to the evolving customer needs.

Margin Woes Persist: High raw material prices due to the Middle-East tensions, the prolonged Russia-Ukraine war and the consequent economic sanctions against the Putin regime have affected the operation schedule of various firms. The demand-supply imbalance has crippled operations and largely affected profitability due to inflated equipment prices. Wireless operators have been facing challenges due to the disruptive rise of over-the-top service providers in this dynamic industry.

Price-sensitive competition for customer retention in the core business is expected to intensify in the coming days. Aggressive competition is likely to limit the ability to attract and retain customers and affect operating and financial results.

For the PQC functionality, SKT developed an algorithm based on the FIPS-203 (CRYSTALS-Kyber) and FIPS-204 (CRYSTALS-Dilithium) standard documents of the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

The Q-HSM chip is designed to be highly versatile, suitable for integration into various devices such as drones, CCTV, home networks, and low-power internet of things (IoT) devices, providing robust protection across multiple sectors. By leveraging quantum random number generation, the chip ensures a high level of security that is resistant to both current and future cyber threats, making it a groundbreaking development in the quest for more secure digital communication.

The Q-HSM chip is set to be commercially launched at the Quantum Korea 2024 event that runs 25-27 June in Ilsan (just north-west of Seoul).

The chip is the first product to come from SK Telecom’s quantum technology alliance that was announced in March, when the telco joined forces with six other prominent companies – Nokia, SOS Lab, Xgate, Wooriro, KCS, and IDQ Korea – to form the Quantum Alliance. The aim of the strategic collaboration is to develop pioneering quantum solutions and engage in joint marketing and business development.

Now the alliance has been officially named as X Quantum, with the members set to pool their expertise and resources to secure a leading position in both domestic and global markets. For further details, see this announcement (in Korean).

Ha Min-yong, global solutions office manager at SK Telecom, expressed optimism about the launch, noting that with the official naming of the alliance as X Quantum and the launch of the first commercial product, the alliance is now embarking on full-scale activities.

The platform aims to be a Google rival, having already received backing from the likes of Nvidia and Amazon boss Jeff Bezos

South Korean telco SK Telecom has announced today that it will invest $10 million in US-based generative AI search engine start up Perplexity.

The two companies will collaborate to further develop Perplexity’s GenAI search engine platform, which is attempting to disrupt Google’s hegemony over the industry.

Founded in 2022, Perplexity AI is an AI-powered search engine that provides direct answers to questions by analysing information from across the internet, rather than just listing websites. It searches the internet in real time, rather than being trained on a fixed dataset (such as Chat GPT), so its answers are more up to date. It currently processes over 230 million search requests each month.

Perplexity and SK Telecom first signed a strategic cooperation agreement at MWC Barcelona in February. Here, the companies agreed that SKT subscribers could use the paid version of Perplexity for free, and the company could use Perplexity’s models to build personal AI assistant products with access to real-time information.

SK Telecom will provide Perplexity with Korean-language data and other content to help improve its large language model.

“Both companies share a vision to provide the best AI services that enrich our lives. We are excited about this partnership and are pleased to have the opportunity to provide Perplexity Pro services to SKT customers,” said Dmitry Shevelenko, Perplexity’s Chief Business Officer.

“Through this investment cooperation with Perplexity, we have secured global competitiveness in the AI search engine market,” said Lee Jae-shin, SKT’s Vice President of AI Growth Strategy.

“Based on the close cooperation between the two companies, we will strengthen A.’s search capabilities and plan to launch the highest level AI personal assistant service at home and abroad,” he continued.

As part of the agreement, Perplexity will also invest in SK Telecom’s Global AI Platform Corporation, which was established last year.

SK Telecom has been hugely vocal in the last two years about its goal of becoming a world leader in AI. The company’s Chief Financial Officer Kim Jin Won has said that the company is “stepping up efforts on all fronts to transform itself into an AI company”, including launching numerous initiatives and making various strategic investments in AI startups.

To this end, last year SK Telecom formed a Global Telco Alliance with e&, Deutsche Telecom, and Singtel to collaborate on the use of AI in the telecoms sector and create new customer and business opportunities.

SK Telecom invests in GenAI search startup Perplexity,SK Telecom invests in GenAI search startup Perplexity,"SK Telecom has invested $10m in Perplexity, a San Francisco-based generative AI (GenAI)-enabled conversational search engine developer with which the South Korean telco struck a strategic partnership in February. SK Telecom, which has been positioning itself as an ‘AI company’ for almost two years (during which time it has made investments in multiple AI-related startups), said the investment will strengthen the partnership and lead to further joint development work on large language model (LLM) developments. “We will map the global AI ecosystem together,” stated SK Telecom in this announcement (in Korean). As part of the new enhanced relationship, Perplexity, which earlier this year raised $62.7m in its Series B round funding, agreed to make future investments in the Global AI Platform Corp. (GAP Co.), which SKT established in Silicon Valley last year. “GAP Co. is SKT's global AI service developer and jointly develops AI search services with Perplexity,” noted the Korean operator.

Perplexity will also collaborate with SK Telecom cooperate on the development of generative AI-based search engines to be integrated in the telco’s AI personal assistants, including its A. (aka Adot) application.

According to SK Telecom, Perplexity's GenAI search engine is “characterised by a short delay time between searching and finding an answer, and providing users with information from accurate sources. Also, unlike keyword search, you can search as if you were communicating with a person, and various search results such as quotes, images, and graphs related to the answer are provided.” The telco expects that integrating the search engine into its AI assistants will enable them to “perform a wide range of functions such as interactive questions, summary of search results, suggestion of related search words, English translation and summary.”

SK Telecom also plans to offer Perplexity Pro, a paid subscription search service, to its customers for free for one year at some point in the future.

“Both companies share a vision to provide the best AI services that enrich our lives,” stated Dmitry Shevelenko, chief business officer (CBO) at Perplexity. “We are pleased to have the opportunity to provide Perplexity Pro services to SKT customers… Partnerships with telecommunications companies that are at the forefront of customers’ daily lives will be a key factor in Perplexity’s growth strategy, and as this is the first case of cooperation with a global telecommunications company, we expect our partnership with SKT to continue in the long term.”

Lee Jae-shin, VP of AI growth strategy at SK Telecom, said: “Through this investment cooperation with Perplexity, we have secured global competitiveness in the AI ​​search engine market. Based on the close cooperation between the two companies, we will strengthen Adot’s search capabilities… We plan to launch the highest level AI personal assistant service at home and abroad.”

When it comes to telco partnerships, Perplexity isn’t only working with SK Telecom: Earlier this year it struck partnership agreements with Deutsche Telekom and Japan’s SoftBank.

At the time, SoftBank’s Head of Consumer Business Promotion Unit, Hiroyuki Terao, noted: “We are delighted to announce our alliance with Perplexity, leading innovators in the realm of AI-powered service. We have continuously transformed people's lives through our philosophy: ‘Information Revolution -Happiness for everyone-’ and offering Perplexity to users in Japan aligns perfectly with this philosophy. This is merely the commencement of our journey. Through this collaboration, we aspire to embody our philosophy in the realm of generative AI.”

Jon Abrahamson, Chief Product & Digital Officer at Deutsche Telekom, stated: “We are in the midst of a technology revolution that will reshape every aspect of our lives, and we at Deutsche Telekom want to assure that its benefits stay open and accessible to everyone. For this reason, we are thrilled at the opportunity to work with Perplexity as they seek to revolutionise search and access to information.”

SK Telecom (SKT) has announced a $10 million investment in generative AI search engine startup Perplexity AI.

The partnership enhances SKT’s presence in the field of generative AI search technology, an area that has drawn considerable interest from major tech companies. The collaboration is expected to bolster SKT’s ‘AI personal assistant’ services.

Perplexity, a rapidly growing rival to Google, has already established a formidable presence in the AI search industry.

Processing over 230 million search requests monthly worldwide, Perplexity has attracted notable investments from industry giants, including Nvidia and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos. It was recently recognised as the leading chatbot in usability by the Wall Street Journal’s “The Great AI Chatbot Challenge”.

The partnership between SKT and Perplexity was first hinted at during the MWC 2024 event in Barcelona, where they signed a strategic cooperation agreement. This new investment further solidifies their commitment to creating sustainable AI business synergies. In addition, Perplexity has agreed to invest in SKT’s Global AI Platform Corporation (GAP Co.), established in Silicon Valley last year to develop AI search services.

Perplexity’s AI search engine is built on a Large Language Model (LLM) and is distinguished by its conversational search capabilities, short response times, and accurate sourcing of information. Unlike traditional keyword searches, it allows users to interact with the AI as if conversing with a person, delivering a variety of related results, including quotes, images, and graphs.

An example of its functionality can be seen when querying about the skills of footballers Ronaldo and Messi. The AI summarises necessary information, such as team performance, awards, and scoring records, providing a comprehensive answer that saves users from sifting through multiple links.

Additionally, Perplexity claims to counter “hallucinations” common in generative AI by providing sources like news articles, YouTube videos, and blog posts. The system also suggests follow-up questions for deeper exploration and offers quick translations and summaries for English articles.

This partnership aims to integrate Perplexity’s generative AI search engine into SKT’s ‘A. (“A dot”)’ AI personal assistant, enhancing its functionality with interactive queries, search result summaries, related search suggestions, and translation services. SKT will contribute Korean data and cultural content, aiding in fine-tuning the LLM and advancing search solutions for better performance in Korean language searches.

Lee Jae-shin, SKT’s Vice President of AI Growth Strategy, commented: “Through this investment cooperation with Perplexity, we have secured global competitiveness in the AI search engine market.

“Based on the close cooperation between the two companies, we will strengthen A.’s search capabilities and plan to launch the highest level AI personal assistant service at home and abroad.”

Dmitry Shevelenko, Perplexity’s Chief Business Officer, added: “Both companies share a vision to provide the best AI services that enrich our lives. We are excited about this partnership and are pleased to have the opportunity to provide Perplexity Pro services to SKT customers.”

SKT plans to offer ‘Perplexity Pro’ – a premium subscription search service, free to its customers for one year – supported by joint marketing efforts through its A. and T Universe channels. This partnership will position SKT as the only domestic telecoms company to offer Perplexity’s services to local customers.

"Roaming Optimization using Global Presence of AWS: SK Telecom Roaming Edge 
Cloud","Roaming Optimization using Global Presence of AWS: SK Telecom Roaming Edge 
Cloud","Communication Service Providers (CSPs) are exploring public cloud hosting of network functions, driven by industry transformation. One promising use case is hosting a network function on AWS for outbound roaming subscribers, leveraging AWS’s global infrastructure and enabling enhanced user experience. This post details a reference architecture, including IP Exchange (IPX) connectivity options, allowing integration with existing roaming networks without changes. It also presents test results from SK Telecom’s proof-of-concept deployment of User Plane Function (UPF) and Packet Data Network Gateway User Plane (PGW-U) on AWS global Regions, demonstrating the feasibility and benefits of this approach.

The telecommunications industry is undergoing a transformative shift as CSPs seek to leverage the power of the AWS Cloud. This shift is driven by the desire for cost efficiency, the need for a fully managed service experience, and the exploration of future directions in the industry. In other contexts of AWS, the core network disaster recovery use case and the 5G Stand-Alone (SA) network buildout cases are introduced. As another use case of leveraging the AWS Cloud for telco core networks, a compelling idea is to host core network functions on AWS global Regions to serve international roaming services of CSPs.

International roaming service plays a crucial role in today’s interconnected world by facilitating seamless communication for travelers. As individuals cross international borders, this service ensures uninterrupted connectivity, fostering business collaborations, maintaining personal connections, and providing essential support in emergencies. The significance of this lies in its ability to bridge distances, creating a more accessible and interconnected global community. Despite the fact that most CSPs already provide international roaming service for their subscribers, an approach in this blog proposes a new architecture for the international outbound roaming service for CSPs. This approach harnesses the global infrastructure of AWS, enabling CSPs to provide an improved user experience for their subscribers while they roam internationally. The proposed solution involves deploying network functions, such as the PGW-U and UPF, on AWS global Regions. By utilizing AWS’ distributed infrastructure, CSPs can offer seamless connectivity and services to their roaming subscribers, regardless of their location. This approach not only improves the user experience but also offers scalability and flexibility, allowing CSPs to adapt to changing demands and technological advancements.

In this blog, the details of the reference architecture and live test results conducted by one of the most innovative CSP of the world, SK Telecom (SKT), are demonstrated. This includes options and considerations for establishing connectivity between AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and IPX providers. This connectivity is crucial for roaming support and forms an essential part of the core network reference architecture on the AWS Cloud. The rest of the blog is structured as follows: first, a quick overview of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) roaming architecture will be presented, followed by an exploration of the reference architecture and technical considerations for VPC, and concluding with a discussion on IPX connectivity. After this, test results from SKT measured in two geographical locations will be demonstrated as proof of concept for the proposed roaming architecture.

Prerequisites – general overview for 3GPP roaming

The 3GPP defines the roaming architecture in the standards with two different scenarios: local breakout (LBO) roaming and home-routed roaming. Figure 1 and 2 show the architecture of home-routed roaming for the 4G and 5G cases, respectively, as defined by referred standards (23.401 for 4G and 23.501 for 5G). In this diagram, HPLMN refers to Home Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN), while VPLMN stands for Visited PLMN, as defined in the standard. LBO roaming refers to the case to break out user traffic at roaming country using a roaming partner’s core network function such as PGW or UPF. Meanwhile, home-route roaming refers to send user traffic back to home country via IPX network, and then break-out traffic to the Internet using home PGW or UPF. Each scenario has its own advantage. More specifically, LBO roaming introduces lower latency driven better user experience of roaming. But it is hard to apply Home PLMN CSP’s own policy since it is using VPLMN partner CSP’s core network functions such as PGW or UPF. On the other hand, home-routed roaming has an advantage to apply HPLMN CSP’s own policy and rule for users (such as rate-control after certain usage amount), but inherently introduces larger delay than the LBO because user traffic has to land at home country of CSP.

In the modern era of global connectivity, international roaming services have become a fundamental offering for CSPs. However, these roaming services also present an opportunity for CSPs to differentiate themselves from competitors. As a result, the practice of home-routed roaming, where outbound roamers’ traffic is routed back to the home network and subjected to the CSP’s policy logic, is more commonly adopted over local breakout methods. By leveraging home-routed roaming, CSPs can apply their own unique policies and optimizations to the roaming traffic, thereby enhancing the user experience and potentially offering differentiated services to their subscribers while they are traveling internationally. This approach allows CSPs to maintain control over the roaming experience and tailor it to their specific requirements, rather than relying solely on the roaming partner’s network capabilities, even though it introduces inevitable latency of service to redirect traffic back to roamer’s home country.

Figure 1. 4G Home-routed Roaming Architecture

Figure 2. 5G Home-routed Roaming Architecture

New architecture proposed by SKT : roaming edge on the AWS Cloud

Reference architecture

When a CSP employs home-routed roaming, user traffic must traverse the overseas link through the IPX network to reach the subscriber’s home country. This can introduce significant propagation delay, depending on the distance between the visited and home countries. To mitigate this issue, SKT designed a new roaming architecture leveraging AWS’ global presence, named Roaming Edge on the AWS Cloud. This approach reroutes user traffic to the AWS Region closest to the visited operator, avoiding inter-countries networks and reducing propagation delay. AWS currently operates in a total of 33 geographic regions worldwide and each AWS Region has multiple, isolated locations known as Availability Zones.

The proposed roaming architecture comprises two distinct patterns. In the first pattern, illustrated in Figure 3, the control plane Network Functions (NFs) are situated within the CSP data center in the home country, while the Packet Data Network Gateway User Plane (PGW-U) and/or User Plane Function (UPF) is deployed across one or more AWS Regions in the visited country. And the VPC that hosts PGW-U and/or UPF is connected to IPX network through AWS Direct Connect (DX). When a subscriber roams to a visited country, all signaling traffic is routed to the home country’s data center via the IPX network. Conversely, user traffic is locally broken out at the nearest AWS Region Internet Gateway (IGW), circumventing the need to traverse overseas links. This approach optimizes the route path, reduces latency, and effectively achieves the same benefits as local breakout roaming in the 3GPP standard while adhering to the CSP’s policy rules.

In the second pattern, depicted in Figure 4, the CSP can leverage the home country’s AWS Region to create a dedicated Packet Data Network Gateway Control Plane (PGW-C) in 4G or Session Management Function (SMF) in 5G for outbound roaming purposes. In both patterns, the PGW-C or SMF is responsible for selecting the proximate PGW-U or UPF to the outbound roamer if multiple PGW-Us/UPFs are deployed across multiple AWS Regions. This geo-proximate PGW-U/UPF selection can be facilitated through the Serving-PLMN (SPLMN) information and User Location Information (ULI) in the message originating from the VPLMN Core Network. The former pattern offers the advantage of leveraging existing PGW-Cs/SMFs in the CSP’s data centers, while the latter pattern allows for the configuration of PGW-U/UPF selection rules at a dedicated PGW-C/SMF in the AWS Cloud.

VPC design

The VPC architecture for the roaming core network on AWS follows the same principles guided in the previous white paper, titled “5G Network Evolution with AWS”.

Figure 5. Roaming Edge VPC reference architecture

Figure 5 illustrates the Roaming Edge VPC reference architecture. For the Proof Of Concept (POC) testing, SKT utilized Samsungs’ cloud-native 4G/5G common core network of PGW-U and UPF. Samsung’s NFs are compatible with running on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Services (EKS), leveraging Multus support for separating networks per each purpose, such as signaling and user traffic. To ensure high availability of network functions, EKS worker node groups need to be deployed across multiple availability zones.

When hosting PGW-U or UPF on the AWS Region, various Internet breakout models can be considered, as illustrated in the blog for data network breakout on AWS. Since this Roaming Edge on the AWS Cloud aims to provide the shortest latency for the Internet breakout at the local country, the use of an Internet Gateway (IGW) based breakout is required. To enable address translation between User Equipment IP (UE IP) and the public IP address (AWS Elastic IP), AWS NAT Gateway (NAT-GW) can be leveraged. Additionally, the use of NAT-GW disallows direct access to resources in private subnets from the Internet, enhancing the security posture of the solution. As another security measure, when PGW-U/UPF is hosted on AWS and makes Internet breakout through IGW, AWS Shield provides baseline protection against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks from the Internet.

Towards the IPX connectivity side (3GPP S8U and N9 interfaces) of PGW-U/UPF, DX via VPN Gateway (VGW) or AWS Transit Gateway (TGW) can be leveraged, as described in the hybrid connectivity whitepaper. Further details on IPX connectivity options and considerations will be provided in the next section.

IPX connectivity using Direct Connect

Establishing interconnectivity between the HPLMN VPC hosting network functions and the IPX provider network is crucial for accommodating NFs for the roaming network. IPX, as defined by the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSMA), is a global, private, multi-service, and secure IP backbone network that connects different service providers. In today’s general 4G/5G roaming (excluding roaming for the Internet of Things), it is necessary to support various multimedia services and ensure reliable connectivity for this interconnection. AWS Direct Connect (DX) can be used to establish a dedicated network connection between an on-premises network and AWS. With a DX connection in place, you can create virtual interfaces directly to the AWS Cloud, bypassing Internet Service Providers (ISPs) networks and ensuring a consistent network experience. However, interconnectivity to the IPX network has a specific requirement to use uniquely routable public IP addresses and public Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) registered in IR.21. Figures 6 and 7 illustrate the best practice design patterns for setting up DX between the HPLMN VPC and DX to meet this requirement.

Figure 6. DX configuration to IPX – pattern1 using ASN overriding and IR.21 registered IP as VPC IP

Figure 7. DX configuration to IPX – pattern2 using eBGP Multi Hop configuration

This blog discusses two patterns for establishing a DX connection between the IPX network and the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) hosting the NF for roaming edge. The first pattern, illustrated in Figure 6, involves setting up Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) peering between the IPX Provider-Edge (PE) router and the AWS Transit Gateway (TGW) using a private Autonomous System Number (ASN). This private ASN is then overridden by the CSP’s ASN registered in IR.21. For the IP address of the NF within the VPC, the CSP’s IR.21 IP address can be used from a private subnet of the VPC, either from the primary VPC CIDR or a secondary CIDR.

As shown in Figure 7, the second pattern involves using eBGP multi-hop (eBGP-MH) to establish a direct BGP connection between the IPX network and the NF within the HPLMN VPC. In this case, the NF inside the HPLMN VPC would use the CSP’s ASN and IR.21 IP address to populate its roaming service IP address directly to the IPX network.

In addition to considering the IR.21 registered IP address and ASN for the DX connection with the IPX network, it is crucial to consider the number of route entries exchanged between the IPX network and AWS DX. Typically, the IPX network advertises all global operators’ roaming networks, which can sometimes be advertised with small CIDR blocks such as /28 or /30, resulting in more than 1,000 route entries being advertised to AWS DX. However, from the perspective of the Roaming Edge VPC in the AWS Region, the path to the IPX network for 3GPP S8 or N9 interfaces can be treated as a default route. Therefore, the IPX network can summarize all roaming networks as a single default route via DX.

Lastly, while two patterns of IPX connectivity are introduced in this blog, there are other options available, such as building an overlay network using a virtual router appliance to logically terminate the IPX network inside AWS VPC rather than at the physical data center of the IPX provider.

Proof of concept test result

SKT has been at the forefront of the mobile industry’s growth since 1984 and has played a crucial role as a global leader by spearheading innovation in communication, cloud, and AI technologies. Throughout 2023, SKT conducted POC testing in two international roaming countries, Spain and Philippines. In this POC, Samsung’s PGW-U and UPF (4G/5G common core) is deployed in the AWS Frankfurt and Hong Kong Regions, with a connection to the BICS‘ IPX network. (Note that, this solution is awarded by WCA 2023 by the name of Roaming Edge Cloud (REC)).

Figure 8. Overview of SKT REC PoC

Using this setup, SKT conducted measurements to evaluate the performance of outbound roaming in terms of measured bandwidth and latency using the Ookla speed test. Furthermore, SKT evaluated real user experience by monitoring global website access speeds (e.g., Netflix and Google) and response time of Google Maps.

As shown in Figure 9, the speed test results confirm improved performance of outbound roaming in terms of throughput, Round Trip Time (RTT), and jitter when the outbound roamer is utilizing the NF hosted on the AWS Region of the visited country. RTT decreased by approximately 84% (from 555ms to 90ms), while the download speed improved by around 30% (from 337 Mbps to 439 Mbps). In addition, as shown in Figure 10, the overall user experience of outbound roaming has demonstrated a more significant and meaningful improvement. For example, the access speed to global websites is reduced by up to 76.9% (Google: from 2.3 seconds to 0.9 seconds, Apple: from 5.7 seconds to 1.3 seconds, Facebook: from 4.0 seconds to 1.4 seconds). In addition, the download time for South Korea’s popular domestic websites integrated with a global content delivery network (CDN) service has been reduced by up to 61.4% (Naver: from 3.2 seconds to 1.9 seconds, Daum: from 13 seconds to 5 seconds), while the response time for searching famous tourist destinations on Google Maps has been improved by up to 43% (from 1.5 seconds to 0.85 seconds).

SK Telecom Loses Ground in Overall Mobile Market but Maintains 5G Lead,SK Telecom Loses Ground in Overall Mobile Market but Maintains 5G Lead,"SEOUL, Jun. 4 (Korea Bizwire) – As the growth of budget mobile carriers persists in South Korea, SK Telecom, the nation’s largest mobile operator, has continued to lose overall market share. However, a new report shows the company still commands a significant portion of 5G subscriptions.

According to a report evaluating the competitiveness of South Korea’s telecommunications market released on June 4 by the Korea Information Society Development Institute (KISDI), SK Telecom’s share of total mobile subscriptions dropped from 41.8% in 2019 to 39.8% in 2022, falling to 39.1% as of June 2023.

As of last June, KT held a 22% share of the market, followed by 20.9% for LG Uplus and 18% for budget carriers known as mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs).

The market share of budget carriers increased by 2.4 percentage points from 2019 to 2022, matching the combined decrease for SK Telecom and KT over the same period at 1.2 percentage points each.

While SK Telecom’s overall mobile subscription share has dipped, the company’s 5G subscriber base has grown, maintaining a share in the upper 40 percent range.

As of the end of 2022, 5G subscription market shares were SK Telecom (47.7%), KT (30.1%), LG Uplus (21.6%), and budget carriers (0.56%). Compared to the previous year, SK Telecom and budget carriers increased by 0.5 and 0.3 percentage points, respectively, while KT and LG Uplus decreased by 0.4 and 0.5 percentage points.

In an evaluation of South Korea’s mobile market structure, the KISDI noted that “key indicators such as the market share of the top carrier and the gap between the top two companies are higher than the OECD average, indicating a relatively concentrated market structure and insufficient competition.”

The level of competition in the high-speed internet market was also assessed as weakening.

The high-speed internet subscription market at the end of 2022 was dominated by KT Group with a 42.3 percent share. SK Group followed with 28.5 percent, LG Group held 24.5 percent, and other providers made up the remaining 4.7 percent.

The institute explained, “The top carrier’s retail revenue share is solidifying in the upper 40 percent range, and new entry and expansion have become difficult,” describing the high-speed internet market as “on the boundary between a market with active competition and one without.”

SK Telecom announced on the 22nd that it will officially launch an artificial intelligence (AI)-based questionnaire service (tentative name 'money-making questionnaire').

The money-making questionnaire is a survey service based on SK Telecom's big data and AI technology, and consists of a questionnaire produced by SK Telecom and a questionnaire conducted through external requests. Both surveys can be participated through the 'Mission' tab within the T membership app.

The self-produced questionnaire, which is uploaded regularly, consists mainly of short questions, so you can participate in the questionnaire without any burden, and you can also check the results of the previous questionnaire.

The external request questionnaire is designed by requesting SK Telecom separately when companies or small business owners want to find out the opinions and reactions of customers. It is characterized by the fact that the questionnaire itself can be exposed only to target customers who are suitable for the response, thereby increasing the accuracy of the questionnaire.

It is useful for both SK Telecom customers and companies participating in the survey response. Customers participate in surveys in their areas of interest and receive T plus points when they complete the survey. The accumulated T Plus points can be used at T membership partners.

The client company can get a lot of accurate responses in a short time. Based on SK Telecom's big data, survey subjects are selected by combining information such as administrative districts and lifestyles, and SKT's AI technology using machine learning is used in the process of targeting subjects. After completing the survey, it even provides an automated AI result analysis report for simple market research.

SKT unveils AI-enabled fixed network controller,SKT unveils AI-enabled fixed network controller,"SK Telecom has deployed an AI-enabled fixed network management platform, dubbed AI Orchestrator, that will “significantly improve network operations efficiency and stability.”

The influential South Korean network operator, which positions itself as an AI company, says it has applied a “code-type infrastructure solution with an AIOps environment” to manage the fixed networks that support its 4G and 5G radio access networks, effectively automating the software defined networking (SDN) processes that are currently in place.

“When a network [operations team member] enters a script in a programming language with which he or she is familiar, it is automatically translated into commands for each device, dramatically improving operational efficiency and stability by integrated inspection and control of tens of thousands of devices nationwide,” noted SK Telecom in this announcement (in Korean).

SKT noted that network operators have been deploying SDN systems in recent years to manage their multivendor network environments, “but there were several limitations, such as high maintenance costs and differences in standardisation” by the equipment vendors.

“AI Orchestrator’s automated system not only overcomes existing limitations by enabling integrated control of the entire equipment but also greatly improves work speed, completing tasks that previously took several days in one day. Errors that can occur during manual management have also been reduced,” stated SK Telecom.

According to the operator, AI ​​Orchestrator automatically manages software version updates and tracks changes, detects potentially harmful commands and can even modify code templates when errors are identified, avoiding lengthy and costly modifications and rebuilds.

The platform also includes “AI-based analysis and model functions” that enables network management operatives to predict events and continuously collects data from network elements so that the operations team can “develop AI models based on stored data, analyse data to determine what actions and inspections are needed in the future, and improve accuracy in detecting network abnormalities and predicting traffic.”

The move is SKT’s latest play towards becoming an AI global leader

South Korean telco SK Telecom has announced that its proposal to standardise technology for AI data centres has been approved as a new research project by the ITU-T (the International Telecommunication Union’s Telecommunication Standardization Sector), a United Nations specialised agency.

The proposal will enhance the interoperability and integration of the technological components within AI data centres and provide a standardised framework for the different aspects of the technology. The proposal establishes three categories: AI Infrastructure, Management, and Resource Allocation.

The ITU-T is responsible for coordinating standards for telecommunications and is comprised of 900 entities from 190 member counties.

At the ITU-T International Conference in Geneva, SK Telecom noted that demand for an international standard for AI data centre-related technologies is rising, due to an increase in AI-related traffic and data centres.

“The ITU-T’s endorsement of our new standardization project not only underscores the international community’s recognition of the importance of AI DC-related technologies but also affirms our extensive AI R&D capabilities in this field,” said Lee Jong-min, Vice President and Head of Future R&D at SK Telecom.

“We aim to finalize the AI DC standard specifications through the collective expertise of SK Group and global partners,” he continued.

SK Telecom has been aiming to become a global AI powerhouse for over a year, with this goal reflected in its subsequent investments. SKT’s Chief Financial Officer Kim Jin Won has confirmed that the company is “stepping up efforts on all fronts to transform itself into an AI company”.

In July last year, SK Telecom, e&, Deutsche Telecom, and Singtel formed a Global Telco AI Alliance to collaborate on the use of AI to create new customer experiences and business opportunities. The companies will co-develop a Telco AI Platform, which will serve as the core foundation for new AI services, including digital assistants and super apps. Last year, the company also invested $100 million in AI firm Anthropic, and became the third-largest shareholder in Persona AI, a South Korean AI technology firm focussing on AI contact centre (AICC) solutions.

SK Telecom said Monday that their proposal for standardizing industry-wide technologies for AI data centers has recently been approved as a new research project by a UN telecom agency.

The ITU-T, a division of the UN-affiliated International Telecommunication Union, is responsible for studying and establishing electrical and telecom standards, with over 900 entities from around 190 member countries joining.

""The ITU-T's endorsement of our new standardization project not only underscores the international community's recognition of the importance of AI DC-related technologies but also affirms our extensive AI R&D capabilities in this field,” said Lee Jong-min, vice president and head of future R&D at SK Telecom. “We aim to finalize the AI DC standard specifications through the collective expertise of SK Group and global partners.""

SK Telecom said the demand for international standards for AI data center-related technologies has been on the rise, as the increased workloads not only lead to higher energy consumption but also prompt operational inefficiency across industries.

The company’s new proposal aims to revise ITU-T’s existing SG 11 requirements and protocols.

The proposal is designed to enhance the interconnection and integration of the fundamental technological components that constitute AI data centers, providing a standardized framework that spans various aspects of data center technologies, including signaling methods and usage.

Moreover, the proposal systematically defines and categorizes the setup into three primary modules based on their functions and roles: AI Infrastructure, Management and Resource Allocation. Each module is tailored to specific aspects of data center operations: AI Infrastructure focuses on AI computing, cooling technologies, and security; Management deals with the oversight of AI DC infrastructure; and Resource Allocation is linked to the virtualization, allocation, and authentication of resources.

Now, SK Telecom is set to work with other member companies to further refine and develop detailed measures concerning data types, interconnection architecture and other aspects. Once these standards are discussed and ultimately adopted through future ITU-T meetings, the standardization proposal will be formalized as a global standard.",https://m.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20240513050533,"SK Telecom said Monday that their proposal for standardizing industry-wide

SK Telecom to unveil LLM for telecom carriers in June,SK Telecom to unveil LLM for telecom carriers in June,"The LLMs will be designed to help telcos improve their customer interactions via digital assistants and chatbots

Korea’s largest telco SK Telecom said it expects to introduce a large language model (LLM) specializing in telecom-related terms next month, according to local press reports. SK Telecom partnered with global firms including OpenAI and Anthropic to develop the LLM.

SK Telecom’s CEO Ryu Young-sang recently highlighted that the telco-specific LLM will likely be commercialize during 2024. Eric Davis, vice president of AI tech collaboration at SK Telecom, had noted that the new LLM would perform about 35% better compared to the GPT-4.

SK Telecom expects the telco-specific LLM would reduce the current time it takes to perform various key tasks including customer consulting, marketing, legal services and human resources. The LLMs will be designed to help telcos improve their customer interactions via digital assistants and chatbots.

After the domestic launch of the LLM offering in early June, the Korean carrier aims to develop multiple LLMs and launch them in other languages at a global level by taking advantage of the Global Telco AI Alliance (GTAA), which was launched by SK Telecom and other partners with the main goal of developing a telco-specific LLM model and related AI services. Other members of the alliance include Deutsche Telekom, e& Group, Singtel Group and SoftBank.

The partners of the GTTA also announced a joint venture with the aim of developing multilingual LLMs optimized for languages including Korean, English, German, Arabic and Japanese, with plans for additional languages to be agreed among the founding members.

Compared to general LLMs, telco-specific LLMs are more specific to the telecommunications domain and better at understanding user intent, the partners said.

The JV also announced plans to focus on deploying innovative AI applications tailored to the needs of the Global AI Telco Alliance members in their respective markets, enabling them to reach a global customer base of approximately 1.3 billion across 50 countries.

The partners also said that the establishment of the JV company is expected to be completed within this year, adding that they have already started work to train the model. This targeted training ensures the LLM understands the unique language and needs of telecom operators.

Last year, SK Telecom and Deutsche Telekom had announced plans to jointly develop an industry-specific language model. The two telcos said that the new offering will be specially tailored to the requirements of digital assistants in customer service and will make easier for telecommunications companies to deploy generative AI models efficiently and quickly.

SK Telecom and Deutsche Telekom had also announced plans to collaborate with AI companies such as Anthropic and Meta to co-develop a multilingual large language model tailored to the needs of telcos, with plans to unveil the first version of the telco-specific LLM in the first quarter of 2024.",https://www.rcrwireless.com/20240502/carriers/sk-telecom-unveil-llm-telecom-carriers-june,"Korea's largest telco SK Telecom said it expects to introduce a large

SK Telecom eyes June launch for its telco-focused LLM,SK Telecom eyes June launch for its telco-focused LLM,"The Korean operator, keen to ensure its generative AI (GenAI) is in tune with the dynamics of the local market, is making use of not one but three LLMs. One has been developed in-house, and is called 'A.X', while the other two are OpenAI's GPT-4, and Anthropic's Claude.

These have been fed a fulsome helping of telco-specific training data – in Korean, naturally – that includes stuff like tariff plans, subsidies, loyalty schemes and such. They have also been trained on SKT's internal guidelines and its ethical AI values. They have even been trained to identify foul and abusive language.

The idea is that SKT will make use of whichever LLM is deemed most equipped to handle a particular query. So, one might fulfil the role of a customer care assistant, while another might be used for network operations, and another for office-based admin work, for example.

""It will not be easy to solve the various problems and provide the services that telecommunication companies are trying to provide with one general-purpose LLM,"" said Eric Davis, head of AI tech collaboration at SKT, in a statement translated from Korean.

""SKT's unique multi-LLM strategy is to create various telco LLMs...and allow them to be selected and used according to the situation,"" he said.

LLM development forms part of the base layer of SKT's AI pyramid strategy. This particular layer is all about AI infrastructure, and in addition to LLMs, also includes data centres for hosting AI applications, and semiconductors – like SKT's forthcoming X330 – designed specifically to handle AI workloads.

The focus turns towards application development in the middle layer of the pyramid, which SKT refers to as AI Transformation (AIX). It plans to work up a range of AI-powered solutions to overhaul its internal operations and business processes first and foremost, and then leverage this experience as the foundation for a suite of offerings to enterprise clients in various verticals.

This part of the plan is also starting to come together, with the unveiling of SKT's Intelligence Platform. SKT is starting close to home with this one – pitching it to telcos that want to efficiently build and develop GenAI applications.

SKT describes it as an 'enterprise AI development and operation package,' and lists call centre bots, chatbots, sales assistants, infrastructure assistants and in-house business innovation among the range of possible use cases.

""We expect that Korean and global telecommunication companies – as well as companies with similar business characteristics, such as consulting work – will be able to reduce the cost and time required to develop a large platform through the Telco LLM Intelligence Platform,"" SKT said.

The uppermost layer of the pyramid is concerned with various customer-facing services, like its A. (pronounced 'A dot') chatbot, among others, which will all be powered by that aforementioned multi-LLM tech.

If all goes according to plan, SKT aims to generate $18.5 billion in AI revenue by 2028. It's a bold ambition given that research firm and sister company Omdia predicts that the entire global GenAI market will be worth $58.5 billion by then.

Somewhat hopeful targets aside, it's impressive to see that SKT has – in a relatively short amount of time – charted a course towards the top of the GenAI pyramid.",https://www.telecoms.com/ai/sk-telecom-eyes-june-launch-for-its-telco-focused-llm,"SK Telecom eyes June launch for its telco-focused LLM.

SK Telecom to unveil LLM for telecom carriers in June,SK Telecom to unveil LLM for telecom carriers in June,"Jeong Min-young, vice president of AI platform at SK Telecom, delivers a presentation during a press conference held at the company's headquarters in Seoul, Tuesday. (SK Telecom)

SK Telecom, Korea's largest wireless carrier by the number of subscribers, said Tuesday it aims to introduce a large language model specializing in telecom-related terms as early as June.

The upcoming telecom-specific LLM is developed from general-purpose LLMs such as ChatGPT and Claude. SK Telecom joined hands with global Big Tech firms including OpenAI and Anthropic to develop the LLM.

Telco-specific LLMs are more adjusted to the telecommunications domain and better at understanding user intent compared to general LLMs.

Earlier this month, the company’s CEO Ryu Young-sang hinted that the time for commercializing the telco-specific LLM will likely be within the year. Eric Davis, vice president of AI tech collaboration at SK Telecom, also previously mentioned that the new LLM would perform about 35 percent better compared to the GPT-4.

The telecom giant has repeated the process of training the model with communication-related data, supervising fine-tuning between general models and custom models, evaluating whether it provides useful answers to inquiries and learning insufficient data to enhance the efficiency and professionalism of its LLM, according to SK Telecom officials.

During the company’s press conference held earlier in the day, Jeong Min-young, vice president of AI platform, said the company expects the telco-specific LLM would reduce the time it takes to perform various key tasks including customer consulting, marketing, legal services and human resources.",https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20240430050666,"SK Telecom, Korea's largest wireless carrier by the number of subscribers,

Microsoft Corp.’s top executives will meet with leaders of South Korea’s four top technology companies next month to discuss ways to strengthen their partnerships in the artificial intelligence business.Kyung Kye-hyun, head of Samsung Electronics Co.'s semiconductor business, Kwak Noh-jung, chief executive of SK Hynix Inc., Cho Joo-wan, CEO of LG Electronics Inc. and SK Telecom Co. CEO Ryu Young-sang were invited to the MS CEO Summit 2024, industry sources said on Monday.At the three-day summit meeting on May 14 in Redmond, Washington, Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella and founder Bill Gates will hold closed-door meetings with the Korean tech firms' leaders to strengthen their AI partnerships, sources said.Microsoft is expected to explore opportunities for joint development and supply of AI chips with Samsung and SK Hynix – the world’s two largest memory chipmakers – and cooperate in AI technology for TVs and other home appliances with LG Electronics. With SK Telecom, the US tech giant is expected to discuss business tie-ups in the 5G telecommunications and cloud sectors, sources said.“It is unusual for MS to invite the Korean Big Tech companies to participate in such a summit and separate meetings,” said a senior official at a Korean tech company.The planned gathering between leaders of Microsoft and the Korean tech firms comes as chipmakers, electronics makers and telecommunications companies seek business tie-ups to gain the upper hand in the booming AI business.Analysts said the Microsoft chiefs’ talks with the Korean CEOs will be mutually beneficial.If Microsoft installs its AI services on Samsung and LG’s electronics goods, it will boost the US firm’s status in competition with rivals such as Google and Meta Platforms, industry officials said.Samsung produces about 300 million smartphones annually while LG Electronics sells 100 million home appliance products a year.Microsoft is already a key customer of Samsung and LG’s AI-enabled smartphones, TVs and other electronic devices.The US company is also a big buyer in the server memory chip market.Samsung and SK Hynix will likely propose ways to make next-generation high-bandwidth memory (HBM) AI chips, Compute Express Link (CXL) devices and solid-state drives (SSDs) for servers, all custom-tailored for Microsoft, sources said.Kyung, chief executive of Samsung’s Device Solutions (DS) division, which oversees its chip business, said last month the company is developing AI accelerators , dubbed Mach-1 and Mach-2, and it will begin mass production of a prototype by the end of this year.Samsung has already agreed to supply Mach-1 AI chips in a deal worth up to 1 trillion won ($752 million) to Korea’s Naver Corp. by year-end, people familiar with the matter said last month.With the contract, Naver plans to significantly reduce its reliance on Nvidia Corp. for chips used in AI inference.Mach-1 is an AI accelerator in the form of a system-on-chip (SoC) that reduces the bottleneck between the graphics processing unit (GPU) and HBM chips, according to Samsung.Leveraging its sale of Mach-1 chips to Naver, Samsung plans to expand its client base to Big Tech firms.

"A week in telecoms: Orange, KT and SK Telecom continue AI drive","A week in telecoms: Orange, KT and SK Telecom continue AI drive","Ericsson, Nokia report Q1 revenue slump but see stronger H2

All eyes were on Ericsson and Nokia this week as they reported results for the first quarter of 2024. As the vendors had previously feared, revenue has continued to decline owing to lower network spending by operators.

Ericsson said organic revenues fell by 14% year-on-year to 53.3bn Swedish krona ($4.88 billion), due mainly to a 19% slump in sales by its Networks division to SEK33.7 billion.

The vendor is also not hopeful that the situation will improve any time soon. Börje Ekholm, President and CEO of Ericsson, said it expects to see a further decline in the RAN market this year “as customers remain cautious with their investments and the pace of investment in India continues to normalize. Dell’Oro estimates the global RAN equipment market will decline by -4% in 2024, which may prove optimistic,” he added.

On a somewhat brighter note, its gross margin (excluding restructuring costs) improved to 42.7% from 39.8% a year earlier while earnings before interest, tax and amortization (EBITA) increased by more than 6% to SEK5.1 billion.

Ekholm added that if current trends persist, “we expect our sales to stabilize during the second half of the year, benefiting from recent contract wins and the normalization of customer inventory levels in North America.”

In terms of new contracts since the end of Q1, Ericsson won an extended deal with Swisscom. Among other aspects, the new agreement will see the introduction of Ericsson Intelligent Automation Platform (EIAP) to provide “comprehensive multi-technology network management and automation for the Swisscom network.”

Nokia said its net sales declined 19% in the first quarter, to reach €4.6 billion. In the Mobile Networks division, business was impacted by particularly low levels of spending in North America and India, which led to a Q1 net sales decline of 37% in constant currency.

However, Nokia also saw an improvement in the gross margin to 48.6% and cited a strong contribution from Nokia Technologies.

Nokia President and CEO Pekka Lundmark also said the Finnish vendor had seen continued improvement in order intake, “meaning we remain confident in a stronger second half and achieving our full year outlook.”

Lundmark added: “We have been executing quickly on the operating model changes we announced back in October along with our cost savings roadmap. These actions, combined with our expectation for improved net sales growth in the second half of the year, supported by our order backlog, mean we are solidly on track to achieve our full year comparable operating profit outlook of €2.3 billion to €2.9 billion and free cash flow conversion of 30% to 60%.

Samsung regains smartphone leadership

IDC and Canalys provided Q1 updates for the global smartphone market that revealed Samsung has regained the top spot, pushing Apple into second place.

Both research firms also put Xiaomi in third place, followed by Transsion and then Oppo.

According to Ryan Reith, group vice president with IDC’s Worldwide Mobility and Consumer Device Trackers, while Apple managed to capture the top spot at the end of 2023, “Samsung successfully reasserted itself as the leading smartphone provider in the first quarter” with a 20.8% market share and shipments of 60.1 million.

IDC also said that global smartphone shipments increased 7.8% year-on-year to 289.4 million units in Q1 2024. “While the industry is not completely out of the woods, as macroeconomic challenges remain in many markets, this marks the third consecutive quarter of shipment growth, a strong indicator that a recovery is well underway,” the research firm added.

Canalys analyst Le Xuan Chiew agreed that the worldwide smartphone market “started the year on a positive note, marking a significant improvement on the same period last year.”

Chiew added: “With the economy stabilizing, new product launches and strong promotional efforts, the market has rebounded, offering smartphone vendors an excellent opportunity to revitalize growth.”

Orange adds Augtera AI platform to its NOC

Orange continued its ongoing application of artificial intelligence-based technologies in order to improve its operations and service delivery.

In a recent move, the France-based operator added the Augtera Network AI platform to its Network Operation Centre (NOC) tools in order to apply AI and ML to daily network operations.

Augtera specialises in AI and ML-powered network operations platforms, and Orange has been trialling its technology over the past two years in “multiple Orange networks” in France and globally.

The operator claims that it will reduce by 70% the daily number of NOC alarms “thanks to Augtera’s network topology knowledge-based auto-correlation.” In addition, it said Augtera’s anomaly detection will help prevent network failures by identifying incidents before they occur.

The integration started in April and will be fully rolled out in Orange Global Networks by the end of 2024.

Jean-Louis Le Roux, Executive Vice President International Networks at Orange, said Augtera AI has been tested in various production environments to assess both the technical capabilities and business outcomes.

“Through a systematic evaluation of multiple use cases, we have identified two initial ones that produced excellent results during the trial. We are pleased to be moving forward to integrate Augtera with our existing NOC tools to bring transformative efficiency and predictability to our operations. This aligns with our ongoing commitment to pioneering the adoption of AI/ML and innovating to provide the best-in-class experience to our customers,” he said.

Rahul Aggarwal, founder and CEO at Augtera Networks, praised Orange for its “visionary” approach to the adoption of AI/ML for network operations and said the operator was among the pioneers to trial Augtera.

KT and SK Telecom invest in AI firm

South Korean operators KT and SK Telecom (SKT) have led a $72 million funding round in domestic AI company Upstage as part of ongoing efforts to boost their AI activities.

Other investors included Korea Development Bank, Shinhan Venture Investment, Hana Ventures, Mirae Asset Venture Investment and Industrial Bank of Korea.

The AI startup’s portfolio includes large language models (LLMs), such as Solar LLM, and its Document AI solution.

Upstage has now raised more than $100 million since its establishment in October 2020. According to the company, this makes it “the most-funded South Korean AI software company in history.”

Sung Kim, co-founder and CEO of Upstage, said the funding “will help us build the world's best generative AI model and deliver the ultimate ‘AGI for work’ solution to businesses worldwide.”

The new financing will be used to accelerate the development of purpose-trained LLMs for global enterprises, with Upstage opening a new office in San Jose, California.

Vodafone Business appoints SAP executive as new CEO

Vodafone Business appointed a senior SAP executive to replace Vinod Kumar, who left the goup at the end of 2023. Marika Auramo will take on the role in July 2024. Since Kumar’s departure, Giorgio Migliarina has been leading the business as interim CEO.

Auramo is currently Chief Business Officer for Europe, Middle East, and Africa at SAP. Prior to that, she was Chief Operating Officer for EMEA North and interim President for the same region. She has spent more than 25 years at SAP.

Margherita Della Valle, CEO of Vodafone Group, said Auramo “brings extensive B2B experience from the IT industry, and I look forward to welcoming her as a member of our Executive Committee.”

Auramo observed that Vodafone Business “has strong growth opportunities ahead – as large corporates, SMEs and the public sector look to adopt more digital tools to enhance growth and productivity – and I will be working alongside my new colleagues to capture this.”

According to the group, Vodafone Business reported service revenue growth of 5% in the fiscal third quarter. Vodafone said the unit is “growing across all segments due to strong public sector demand and increasing customer adoption of new digital services, such as cloud, security and IoT.”

Samsung regains smartphone leadership

IDC and Canalys provided Q1 updates for the global smartphone market that revealed Samsung has regained the top spot, pushing Apple into second place.

Both research firms also put Xiaomi in third place, followed by Transsion and then Oppo.

According to Ryan Reith, group vice president with IDC’s Worldwide Mobility and Consumer Device Trackers, while Apple managed to capture the top spot at the end of 2023, “Samsung successfully reasserted itself as the leading smartphone provider in the first quarter” with a 20.8% market share and shipments of 60.1 million.

IDC also said that global smartphone shipments increased 7.8% year-on-year to 289.4 million units in Q1 2024. “While the industry is not completely out of the woods, as macroeconomic challenges remain in many markets, this marks the third consecutive quarter of shipment growth, a strong indicator that a recovery is well underway,” the research firm added.

Canalys analyst Le Xuan Chiew agreed that the worldwide smartphone market “started the year on a positive note, marking a significant improvement on the same period last year.”

Chiew added: “With the economy stabilizing, new product launches and strong promotional efforts, the market has rebounded, offering smartphone vendors an excellent opportunity to revitalize growth.”

Orange adds Augtera AI platform to its NOC

Orange continued its ongoing application of artificial intelligence-based technologies in order to improve its operations and service delivery.

In a recent move, the France-based operator added the Augtera Network AI platform to its Network Operation Centre (NOC) tools in order to apply AI and ML to daily network operations.

Augtera specialises in AI and ML-powered network operations platforms, and Orange has been trialling its technology over the past two years in “multiple Orange networks” in France and globally.

The operator claims that it will reduce by 70% the daily number of NOC alarms “thanks to Augtera’s network topology knowledge-based auto-correlation.” In addition, it said Augtera’s anomaly detection will help prevent network failures by identifying incidents before they occur.

The integration started in April and will be fully rolled out in Orange Global Networks by the end of 2024.

Jean-Louis Le Roux, Executive Vice President International Networks at Orange, said Augtera AI has been tested in various production environments to assess both the technical capabilities and business outcomes.

“Through a systematic evaluation of multiple use cases, we have identified two initial ones that produced excellent results during the trial. We are pleased to be moving forward to integrate Augtera with our existing NOC tools to bring transformative efficiency and predictability to our operations. This aligns with our ongoing commitment to pioneering the adoption of AI/ML and innovating to provide the best-in-class experience to our customers,” he said.

Rahul Aggarwal, founder and CEO at Augtera Networks, praised Orange for its “visionary” approach to the adoption of AI/ML for network operations and said the operator was among the pioneers to trial Augtera.

KT and SK Telecom invest in AI firm

South Korean operators KT and SK Telecom (SKT) have led a $72 million funding round in domestic AI company Upstage as part of ongoing efforts to boost their AI activities.

Other investors included Korea Development Bank, Shinhan Venture Investment, Hana Ventures, Mirae Asset Venture Investment and Industrial Bank of Korea.

The AI startup’s portfolio includes large language models (LLMs), such as Solar LLM, and its Document AI solution.

Upstage has now raised more than $100 million since its establishment in October 2020. According to the company, this makes it “the most-funded South Korean AI software company in history.”

Sung Kim, co-founder and CEO of Upstage, said the funding “will help us build the world's best generative AI model and deliver the ultimate ‘AGI for work’ solution to businesses worldwide.”

The new financing will be used to accelerate the development of purpose-trained LLMs for global enterprises, with Upstage opening a new office in San Jose, California.

Vodafone Business appoints SAP executive as new CEO

Vodafone Business appointed a senior SAP executive to replace Vinod Kumar, who left the goup at the end of 2023. Marika Auramo will take on the role in July 2024. Since Kumar’s departure, Giorgio Migliarina has been leading the business as interim CEO.

Auramo is currently Chief Business Officer for Europe, Middle East, and Africa at SAP. Prior to that, she was Chief Operating Officer for EMEA North and interim President for the same region. She has spent more than 25 years at SAP.

Margherita Della Valle, CEO of Vodafone Group, said Auramo “brings extensive B2B experience from the IT industry, and I look forward to welcoming her as a member of our Executive Committee.”

Auramo observed that Vodafone Business “has strong growth opportunities ahead – as large corporates, SMEs and the public sector look to adopt more digital tools to enhance growth and productivity – and I will be working alongside my new colleagues to capture this.”

SK Telecom’s enduring belief in Metaverse spells hope for the technology,SK Telecom’s enduring belief in Metaverse spells hope for the technology,"All is not lost for the metaverse as South Korea’s biggest service provider undertakes expansion of its metaverse platform

Young digital-savvy population coupled with fast 5G deployment have set the foundation for metaverse’s growth in the region

Even so, it will be some time before the metaverse ecosystem matures

South Korea’s largest service provider, SK Telecom, continues to back the metaverse despite its limited global uptake.

The service provider was recently in the news for forming partnerships with CelcomDigi, Malaysia’s largest mobile carrier; Agate, an Indonesian game publisher; and Philippine-based Cherry and Cosmic Technologies, to expand the reach of its metaverse platform, ifland.

SK Telecom plans to expand beyond the Asia Pacific region to other global markets, including America. According to the press release, the service provider will soon support different languages, including Malay, Indonesian, Hindi, and Spanish. It already supports German, English, Korean, Chinese and Japanese languages.

“Malaysia and Philippines are important markets for ifland’s global expansion,” said Yang Maeng-seok, head of SK Telecom’s metaverse division.

“Through partnerships, SK Telecom will offer tailored content and marketing services for ifland in the three countries (Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines). In exchange, partners gain access to the metaverse ecosystem without upfront platform development expenses. SK Telecom foresees accelerated global expansion for ifland, with partners adapting content to local cultures and while it leverages their market insights and customer bases,” said Arun Menon, principal analyst, MTN Consulting.

Why is SK Telecom betting on metaverse?

SK Telecom was one of the first service providers globally to launch a metaverse platform, ifland, in 2021. However, by all indications, metaverse has failed to live up to its initial promise.

Even so, the demographics of the Southeast Asia (SEA) region are perfect for metaverse’s growth in the future. A large young and tech-savvy population and growing content consumption in the SEA region make it a lucrative area for SK Telecom.

“SK Telecom is likely to scale in these markets using a tailor-made approach to appeal to consumers by offering differentiated content. These markets hold potential for SK Telecom. As 5G coverage increases in the region, AR/VR use cases will likely facilitate these offerings at an increased rate,” explained Glen Cardoza, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research.

“SK Telecom has built a strong telecom and content base in South Korea, and they have made it evident that they would like to diversify into more promising markets in the SEA region. The growth of Metaverse has been slow in recent years, even for the SEA region. However, the SEA countries have shown potential in an ongoing digital transformation. This is likely to be a big consideration factor for SK Telecom,” Cardoza added.

Another reason behind SK Telecom’s pursuit of metaverse expansion is strong backing of the South Korean government’s backing. “The [South Korean] government has investment plans of more than $200 million to develop the country’s Metaverse ecosystem. The government has also established a Metaverse Fund aimed at propelling economic expansion through strategic investments in metaverse technologies,” Menon said.

Additionally, the region has taken the lead in 5G deployment, which is crucial to the adoption of bandwidth-heavy technologies like metaverse. China and South Korea were among the first countries to launch 5G.

Some would argue that metaverse is not a lost cause in the region. “The potential impact of the metaverse to GDP in Asia is about $0.8T-1.4T per year by 2035, roughly 1.3 – 2.4% of overall GDP,” according to a Deloitte report.

At the same time, metaverse is likely to face several challenges as it expands in the region. “The metaverse is an emerging sector, but its development in the SEA region still lags somewhat. Before that, certain infrastructure elements, such as 5G and content ecosystems, still require some time to develop. We believe that in the short term, the hardware sales or ecosystem of the Metaverse may develop slightly better in countries or regions with relatively higher per capita income,” said Ivan Lam, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research.

“While there's potential for growth given the region's increasing digital connectivity and tech-savvy population, widespread adoption may take time,” Menon concluded.",https://www.fierce-network.com/wireless/sk-telecoms-enduring-belief-metaverse-spells-hope-technology,"SK Telecom's enduring belief in metaverse spells hope for the technology ·

The metaverse concept, popularized by science fiction and, more recently, by technology companies, represents a convergence of virtual reality, augmented reality, and the internet. SK Telecom's entrance into this arena signifies its acknowledgment of the metaverse as a significant trend that heralds the potential for widespread adoption and economic impact.

Fostering Growth

The South Korean operator announced in a translated statement that it has expanded its ifland partner list to include Malaysian telco, CelcomDigi, and CHERRY—a Philippine Internet of Things (IoT) platform.

The agreements will provide a locally-optimized metaverse platform, with CelcomDigi and CHERRY focusing on local brand partnerships, specialized marketing, and primary customer support in their respective markets.

The objective is to expedite the growth of ifland into Southeast Asia. Additionally, it's important to highlight that CelcomDigi had previously committed to partnering with SKT on metaverse initiatives. Both companies previously announced their collaboration on expanding ifland and innovating new business concepts.

Yang Maeng-seok, the head of SK Telecom's metaverse division, cited Malaysia and the Philippines as key markets for ifland's international expansion. He went on to say that through collaboration with local companies and the introduction of AI, the company will be reborn as a 'global AI metaverse.'

CelcomDigi's Chief Innovation Officer, Kugan Thirunavakarasu, stated that the company will work to innovate in the metaverse and increase customer value through CelcomDigi's network technology and AI-based solutions.

Navigating New Markets

In addition to its activities in the Asia Pacific region, SKT has expressed its commitment to exploring partnerships in the Americas while emphasizing the interplay between the metaverse and AI.

SK Telecom embraces ODA to support Global Telco AI Alliance,SK Telecom embraces ODA to support Global Telco AI Alliance,"The Global Telco AI Alliance has made strides in developing Large Language Models (LLMs) for telecom operators since it was formed in July 2023. As the group works to fine-tune and commercialize AI models, TM Forum’s Open Digital Architecture (ODA) is set to play an integral role in helping the initiative to scale.

Founded by Deutsche Telekom, e&, Singtel and SK Telecom, the Alliance members formalized their commitment in February with plans to create a joint venture company and added Softbank to the group.

In an interview with TM Forum's Inform, Will Cho Sang-hyuk, Vice President of Strategic Partnerships at SK Telecom, explained why ODA is important for telco implementations of Generative AI (GenAI) and shared next steps for the organization.

“[Operators] are excited about GenAI and thought using big tech companies’ APIs is sufficient to apply the technology to respective telco use cases, but this is not true … Without seamless integration with the back-end system, you cannot achieve the outcome you want to deliver for customer satisfaction,” he said.

The Alliance is initially focused on creating LLMs to support digital assistants and chatbots to improve customer interactions by making them more conversational. Examples of the GenAI use cases include providing real-time assistance to call center agents and generating post-call summaries.

Customer service use cases require access to Business Support Systems and Operational Support Systems (BSS/OSS), and the Alliance needed a standard way for LLMs to integrate with telco systems without having to handle “scores of APIs,” he explained. This is where ODA comes in.

“The ODA framework is an efficient tool to solve this issue at scale. If we can aggregate collective requirements of telcos wanting to apply GenAI to call center and other business cases, we have a more cohesive platform to collaborate on. TM Forum is a really good platform for that,” he said.

SK Telecom joined TM Forum in February to collaborate with peers and share knowledge around GenAI and telco AI models. The operator’s corporate strategy is to become an AI company and it plans to leverage ODA and Open APIs to support its transformation as well as help to extend ODA to be AI-ready.

The telco also hopes to expand the Global Telco AI Alliance through its partnership with TM Forum. “There should be various ways to encourage the TM Forum members to get involved with this Alliance and open standards is one of them. We also seek tech partners for the Alliance, including BSS and OSS companies,” said Chung Suk-geun, Chief AI Global Officer at SK Telecom in an interview with Nik Willetts, CEO of TM Forum.

Alliance formalizes AI ambition

The Alliance’s five members have committed to creating a JV, with each contributing an equal, undisclosed investment. This will establish a legal entity for joint development work on LLMs and for engaging with LLM providers, communications service providers and other tech partners.

The new company will be able to procure basic LLM components and aggregate anonymized data from telco members as well as their “token consumption”. By combining LLM demand from five telcos, with total customer base of around 1.3 billion, the Alliance JV will be able to negotiate better terms and receive strategic and technical support from LLM developers, such as Anthropic or OpenAI, compared to one operator.

“Many companies sign MOUs and announces partnerships … but without formalised commitment … it doesn't have any follow through. That's why we wanted to create this vehicle to deliver tangible outcomes,” said Cho.

Together, the founding operators will create telco-specific LLMs and LLMOps to be used across their own operations. Initial LLMs will be optimized for Arabic, English, German, Japanese and Korean and there are plans for supporting additional languages.

The Alliance aims to make the telco LLMs easy to use on a platform-as-a-service model.

Learning to speak telco

The LLMs will also be trained to learn the language of the telco industry. That is, fine-tuning the models for telco-specific questions related to customer equipment, contracts or service troubleshooting. With an understanding of telco operations, LLMs can make chatbots more sophisticated and able to handle a wider range of complex customer interactions and provide more helpful responses.

The Alliance has said that LLM training is underway. The first joint development agreement was announced by Deutsche Telekom and SK Telecom in October 2023.

For example, if a customer contacts their service provider to say they are thinking of leaving because their bill is too high, a chatbot powered by an off-the-self LLM might show the customer the easiest way to stop the service. But a telco LLM would be trained to help the customer find a better service plan to meet their needs.

SK Telecom’s Cho said telco LLMs can make call center agents’ jobs easier while improving customer satisfaction. Using telco-specific LLMs, agents can have faster access to information from BSS and OSS systems to support customer queries, such as contract details, rather than manually searching for details.

“If it is telco LLM, tailored for telco use cases, we fine tune the model using telcos’ proprietary data and connect it the BSS/OSS system … We can collapse those lead times … and reduce the cognitive burden on the call center agent’s shoulder… So it’s a win-win for customers and agents,” said Cho.

This can drive cost savings for operators by increasing call center agent retention and streamlining the training of new agents. “It is beneficial for the operator because retaining and training good call center agents takes time and money,” he said.

In addition, SK Telecom will introduce a 'user-customized voice' to A-DOT. As a leader in the global telecommunications industry, the message is that it will become the center of AI services. In an interview with Maeil Business, Park Byung-kwan, vice president of AI Tech Products, emphasized AI strategies of ""self-reliance"" and ""cooperation."" (Full Story)

- What kind of tasks are you in charge of within SKT?

▶ It oversees voice recognition, voice synthesis, and large language model (LLM) applications. For example, let's summarize the call and try to convey it by voice. Voice recognition is required to convert voice into text, LLM application is required to summarize it, and voice synthesis technology is required to answer it with voice again.

- What kind of service are you preparing right now?

▶What we are currently preparing is a personalized voice service. It is a technology that can deliver 20 to 30 sentences in the voice of a specific person. (I am curious about the specific voice) The service team will prepare it separately. For example, if you send a text message in an absent message when you get a call, the other party can hear it in my voice. The service will be available soon through AI Agent A-DOT. Voice synthesis used to be unnatural, but now it's quite natural.

- SK Telecom is leading the Telco Alliance. Is there a separate technology development?

We are preparing an AI contact center for ▶ Telco. This is a work for Telco Alliance, a global carrier alliance. The reasons why carriers build LLM will be largely similar. It is an AI-based contact center for this purpose. The AI contact center can first receive and sort before the customer calls the counselor. It can help the counselor and reduce the burden of work.

사진 확대 Park Byung-kwan, Vice President of SK Telecom

- Please let me know if you are developing other technologies.

▶We are building an infrastructure operation chatbot. Knowledge management 2.0. Previously, company know-how was accumulated only as data, but if it is linked with AI, necessary data can be shared within the company. It is an in-house chatbot. I would like to share more use cases and cooperate with Telco Alliance.

(SK Telecom has signed a joint venture (JV) for AI business cooperation with four companies belonging to the global Telco AI Alliance, Deutsche Telekom (Germany), Softbank (Japan), Singtel (Singapore), and EN (UAE) at MWC24.)

- What is SK Telecom's AI strategy?

▶What SK Telecom does is self-discipline and cooperation. Self-developed self-development is also necessary, but external technology must also be obtained. This is cooperation. You can't move the market if it's not on the scale. It is necessary to work with the outside world to create economies of scale. Previously, GPT was used to summarize currencies. However, it is A.X LLM that internalizes it because it is expensive. Infrastructure data should not go outside. Internal models are also needed.

- Does it mean that both internal development and external collaboration will take place?

▶ If you rely solely on external partners, you become subordinate. We always think about synergy. But we need services right away. When it is a good external model, it cooperates and internalizes what is needed. That's exactly what the call summary was like. The summary generates a lot of traffic and costs a lot of money. It was judged that it was important for SK Telecom to develop a summary model on its own.

사진 확대 Park Byung-kwan, Vice President of SK Telecom

▶ I developed an AI model myself. However, the model alone does not provide the service. B2C service costs a lot of money. Accuracy is also a problem. In that case, other skills will be needed. Sometimes old skills are needed. The goal is to provide services using not only AI technology models but also existing technologies. LLM development is not the only thing. I would like to do something that can be serviced by filling in the necessary elements.

- SK Telecom CEO Yoo Young-sang emphasized AI governance. (At the general shareholders' meeting held on March 26, 2024, CEO Yoo Young-sang was re-elected with an additional three-year term guaranteed. SK Telecom has declared its vision to raise sales from 17.6086 trillion won last year to 25 trillion won in 2028 based on AI and other factors. CEO Yoo said, ""When I declared SK Telecom's new vision, AI Company, many people wondered,"" adding, ""We will show tangible results by implementing concrete strategies in the future."" He also explained, ""We will implement various attempts on AI governance, which is increasingly emphasized in order to strengthen its competitiveness as an AI company."" It declared 'T.H.E.AI', the principle of AI governance. Specifically, the message is that it will use Telco to increase AI ethics for people and customers.

▶One of the rewarding tasks we did was to link OCR technology, which is image recognition, with Sullivan Plus. It was a model that cooperated with social enterprises. It is a service for the visually impaired. For example, if you take a picture at a convenience store, the AI will tell you where each product is. In the meantime, there have been few Korean AI services. I wanted to create a skill that would help someone.

- I'm curious about the goal of the team.

▶ My goal is to make a good Telco use case. (Earlier, SK Telecom invested $100 million in Enthropics, which produced Claude AI.) In the future, we will jointly develop an LLM dedicated to Telco. It was decided that various services should be applied to A-DOT. Voice recognition and voice synthesis are also required, and chatbots as well as callbots are needed. Therefore, SK Telecom has an organization called AI Tech Product.

""After 40 years of writing ICT Korea's history, SK Telecom is now launching a new challenge for the 'Global AI Company'.""

At the 40th regular shareholders' meeting held at the T Tower of the headquarters in Euljiro, Jung-gu, Seoul on the 26th, SKT CEO Yoo Young-sang announced his plan for a new AI business. It is determined to solidify its No. 1 position in the industry by preemptively fostering future food products in addition to its main telecommunications business, which has faced growth limits.

At the shareholders' meeting, Yoo was re-elected as an in-house director with an overwhelming 98.4% approval support from shareholders based on steady earnings growth. Analysts say that behind Yoo's solid approval rating lies in improving business efficiency and future competitiveness through AI.

President Yoo announced the specific business status and future vision under the ""AI pyramid"" strategy. It aims to make this year a year to visualize the specific achievements of the AI business.

The AI pyramid strategy is a new AI business strategy that President Yoo is taking a strong drive. It is characterized by grouping the three areas of ▲AI infrastructure ▲ AIX ▲ AI service step by step in the form of pyramids. It aims to innovate in all areas of industry and life. As he will lead SKT for three more years after serving consecutive terms this year, it is expected that the strategy will be more powerful.

In the 'AI infrastructure' area, which is the first stage of the pyramid, the data center will be expanded to more than 200MW by 2030, doubling its current capacity. It plans to strengthen its business competitiveness by packaging solutions for AI data center-related capabilities such as ""AI semiconductor"" competitiveness of Safion and SK Hynix, ""liquid immersion cooling technology,"" a next-generation data center heat management method, and SK Broadband's ""AIDCIM.""

It is also planned to evolve into AI infrastructure in the long run by increasing the efficiency of operating costs as well as AI-based facility investment in existing wired and wireless networks. The development of global communication LLM (giant language model) and the establishment of a joint venture announced at MWC2024 with Deutsche Telekom, E&N, Singtel, and Softbank are also cruising, and the goal is to secure global commercial cases within the year.

In the 'AIX area', the second floor of the pyramid, the competitiveness of wired and wireless communication will be strengthened through the evolution of AI customer centers and super-personalized AI media. At the same time, it will start its enterprise AI business in earnest. The 'Enterprise AI Market', which opened in January, provides various LLMs such as AOTX, Antropics, and OpenAI to companies and public institutions.

Through 'AI service', which is the peak of the pyramid, the policy is to retake customer engagement. While advancing AI personal secretary A. to evolve into a personal AI assistant (PAA), it will also secure references that can be expanded globally and promote global PAA development at the same time.

ESG competitiveness will also be enhanced through 'AI'. At the shareholders' meeting, the current AI governance principle 'T.H.E.AI' was also unveiled. In line with the global trend of the need for AI technology regulation, SKT is currently operating an organization dedicated to AI governance. In the process of developing and operating AI governance processes and AI technologies and services, we are establishing internal standards that members must comply with.

On the agenda of the general shareholders' meeting, ▲ financial statements approval ▲ partial changes in the articles of incorporation ▲ appointment of directors ▲ appointment of members of the Audit Committee ▲ approval of the remuneration limit for directors ▲ revision of the executive remuneration payment regulations were proposed.

The consolidated financial statements for 2023 were approved with annual sales of 17.6085 trillion won and operating profit of 1.7532 trillion won, up 1.8% and 8.8% year-on-year, respectively. It was well received by shareholders for its achievements centered on the consolidation of market dominance and new growth businesses in its main business, the wired and wireless telecommunications industry.

As astronomical investments must be made in the AI business, global investment and financial capabilities have also been greatly strengthened. Global risk management expert Roh Mi-kyung, CFO Kim Yang-seop, and CFO Lee Seong-hyung of SK Co., Ltd. were placed at the front line of management as new outside directors, inside directors, and other non-executive directors, respectively.

During the Q&A session with shareholders, new business plans, achievements, and shareholder return policies emerged as the biggest topics.

Asked how to respond to the government's recent value-up program, President Yoo replied, ""We will pursue multi-level rise through Asia in the mid- to long-term by starting our AI strategy in earnest.""

Shareholders' interest in the progress of the ""UAM"" business, which is considered one of SKT's representative future foods, was also poured out.

President Yoo said, ""Through a partnership with 'Jobe Eviation', a leading global UAM company, we will successfully carry out the 'K-UAM Grand Challenge' demonstration project scheduled within this year and secure business rights to advance into the global market as well as preempt domestic business leadership.""

It also strengthens shareholder value. Through some changes in the articles of incorporation, the process related to the dividend base date has been improved so that investors can check and invest in the amount of dividends at the end of the year first. The existing end-of-year dividend base date was deleted and changed to shareholder-friendly so that the board of directors could set the end-of-year dividend base date. The new dividend base date articles of incorporation will apply from dividends at the end of 2024. The dividend per share was confirmed to be 3,540 won per year, up 6.6% year-on-year.",https://www.mk.co.kr/en/business/10974535,"""After 40 years of writing ICT Korea's history, SK Telecom is now launching

"SK, KT, LG face mounting pressure to cut expensive phone plans","SK, KT, LG face mounting pressure to cut expensive phone plans","By Baek Byung-yeul

SK Telecom, KT and LG Uplus are facing continued pressure from the government to lower their customers' monthly bill payments. However, according to industry officials and experts on Monday, concerns have been raised that such price cuts could lead to a reduction in their capacity to invest as well as decrease the overall level of industrial competitiveness.

To reduce the burden on households, the Yoon Suk Yeol administration has been pushing for a reduction in monthly bill payments, asking the mobile carriers to offer lower price plans and enhance benefits for socially vulnerable groups.

In response to the government's demands, telecommunications companies have allowed users to subscribe to both 5G and the slower LTE services since the beginning of this year, and a low-cost 5G plan of around 30,000 won (around $22) is also expected to be released soon.

However, with the April 10 general elections approaching, the government has continued to pressure the companies to offer lower fees, sparking concerns over political interference in market regulations.

""While there are investors hoping that the government-led Corporate Value-up Program could ease regulations on domestic telecommunications companies, the likelihood of this becoming a reality is slim,"" Kim Hong-sik, a researcher at Hana Securities, said. ""This is because telecom firms are still reluctant to invest in networks, and the issue of communication fees is closely related to the elections.""

The government’s latest action to lower monthly bills came last week as Kim Hong-il, chairman of the Korea Communications Commission (KCC), a state-run communication services regulator, asked top executives of the mobile carriers and mobile phone makers – Samsung Electronics and Apple – to increase subsidies for users who change their mobile carrier when purchasing new phones.

“During the meeting, the chairman specifically requested the operators’ special cooperation regarding the recently introduced policy of support funds for switching to alleviate the burden of household communication expenses and to vitalize competition,"" the KCC said.

Support funds for switching refers to a system where mobile carriers can provide subsidies when consumers switch carriers upon purchasing new phones. It is designed so that users who subscribe to expensive monthly plans can receive more subsidies.

""We requested the mobile carriers and mobile phone manufacturers to expand the subsidies, and they promised to actively cooperate,"" Pan Sang-kwon, director of government affairs at KCC said, after the meeting. “It is expected to be increased to a level that can be felt by the public.""

In response to the request, the three mobile carriers announced on March 23, the next day, that they would provide subsidies ranging from a minimum of 30,000 won to a maximum of 330,000 won.

Industry officials said the government's continued pressure to lower prices would result in reduced investment capacity of the companies.

""The telecommunications business essentially requires a lot of capital investment, such as network equipment investments. While it is natural to align with government policies, support for measures that can invest more in the transition to the AI era, preparation for the upcoming 6G network and new businesses, such as air mobility and self-driving cars, are also needed,"" an official in the telecommunications industry said on condition of anonymity.

Kim Yong-jae, a business professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, said Korea’s communications fees are not as expensive as some other developed countries such as the United States, Germany, Sweden and Japan.

""Korea's telecommunication fees cannot be considered cheap, but they are not excessively expensive either. Looking at the overall level of fees, they are around the average,"" the professor said during a forum held last September, hosted by Rep. Kim Yeung-shik of the People Power Party. ""Especially when bundled with wired products, Korea’s fee level is relatively cheaper.”

The government's pressure to lower cell phone fees appears to have been somewhat successful in slowing the increase in household telecommunication expenses. According to the statistics from Statistics Korea, the average monthly mobile bill per household last year was 128,000 won, up 3.5 percent from 124,000 won in 2021, but the amount remained the same as in 2022.",https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2024/06/129_371353.html,"SK Telecom, KT and LG Uplus are facing continued pressure from the

SK Telecom and LG Uplus are planning to release a 5G plan worth 30,000 won this week.

Including KT, which has already offered the lowest 5G rate, the 3 mobile telecommunication companies' 5G plan will be available in the 30,000 won range.

In addition, over the weekend, mobile carriers are expected to raise their conversion support funds to the early 300,000 won range, lowering the overall burden of communication costs.

According to the telecommunications industry on the 24th, SK Telecom and LG Uplus are coordinating with the Ministry of Science and ICT by preparing a 5G plan reform plan to lower the lower limit to 30,000 won but subdivide small sections of 5G data.

Considering that the deadline for introducing a 5G plan in the 30,000 won range announced by the Ministry of Science and ICT in November last year is the first quarter of this year, the low-cost plan is expected to come out this week.

SK Telecom and LG Uplus are likely to come up with a plan that gives them a little more data as the launch is later than KT. KT's ""5G Slim 4GB"" plan released in January provides 4GB of data for a monthly fee of 37,000 won. SK Telecom and LG Uplus are also considering reorganizing their existing rate plans to subdivide them or increase the amount of data they provide.

The 30,000 won plan is expected to be the de facto final stage of the government's reduction of telecommunication costs. In this regard, the government declared a push to abolish the Act on the Improvement of the Distribution Structure of Mobile Communication Terminal Devices (Short-Term Communication Act) and enacted a notice to pay up to 500,000 won in number transfer support to lower the actual burden of communication costs even before the abolition, inducing market competition. However, when telecommunication companies did not release the conversion support fund as expected, such as offering up to 130,000 won, Kim Hong-il, chairman of the Korea Communications Commission, met with the representatives of the three telecommunication companies and the president of Samsung Electronics on the 22nd to ask for cooperation in reducing communication costs.

As of the 23rd, telecommunication companies have raised their number transfer support funds by up to 330,000 won depending on the plan and mobile phone terminal model. SK Telecom, KT, and LG Uplus set a price of 30,000 won to 330,000 won as a subsidy for switching numbers when changing mobile carriers.

KT is the place that pays the most amount-based number transfer support funds, and it provides 50,000 to 330,000 won to 15 types of mobile phone terminals according to the plan. Galaxy Z Flip 5 and Fold 5 and Galaxy S22 series have been added as payment models, and iPhone 14 series and Galaxy Z Flip 4 and Fold 4 have increased their conversion support payments by about 2.5 times.

If you sign up for the monthly plan of more than 90,000 won, you can receive a conversion subsidy of 50,000 won to 80,000 won when purchasing Samsung Electronics' flagship smartphone Galaxy S24 series.

SK Telecom will provide 132,000 won to 320,000 won in number transfer support for 13 types of handsets, including the Galaxy Z Fold 5, S23 series, and iPhone 14 series. In particular, if you purchase the Galaxy Z Fold 4, you can receive up to 1 million won by adding an official subsidy of up to 720,000 won and a conversion subsidy of up to 280,000 won, depending on the plan.

LG U+ will provide support from 30,000 won to 300,000 won for 11 types of handsets, including the Galaxy S24 series, Z Flip 5, Fold 5, S23 series, and iPhone 15 Pro. Depending on the plan, the Galaxy S24 series will be paid up to 60,000 won, and the Galaxy S23 series and Galaxy Z Fold 5, which were released last year, will be paid 100,000 won to 300,000 won.

SK Telecom’s AI chief provides a strategic update,SK Telecom’s AI chief provides a strategic update,"SK Telecom (SKT) has been under the spotlight lately for its ambition to become a leading AI company by embedding the technology at the heart of a range of connectivity solutions, and is now in full swing working on turning its vision into a reality.

The operator’s chief AI global officer, Suk Geun Chung, spoke with TelecomTV at Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2024 in Barcelona, to provide an update on how SKT has delivered on its AI-based strategy since it first unveiled its new focus in 2022.

“We started some internal capacity development, so we would develop our own LLM [large language model] and after that, we made progress by collaborating with outside [companies,]” he explained.

Central to these efforts are SKT’s collaboration and $100m investment into AI company Anthropic, as well as working with OpenAI – the developer behind generative AI (GenAI) system ChatGPT – and hyperscaler companies. Chung noted that SKT is relying on technology developed by these partners to transform its internal operations and make them more efficient.

Another focal point of the South Korean operator’s vision is the initiative to create a joint venture from the Global Telco AI Alliance – an initiative the telco unveiled in mid-2023 alongside partners Deutsche Telekom, e& and Singtel, and was recently joined by SoftBank. Among its main goals is to build a telco-specific LLM as a means to make GenAI developments easier and quicker for operators.

Chung explained that the founding of the new joint venture is expected to be finalised in 2024, after which the members plan to commercialise the telco LLM on which they have already been collaborating.

In other hot AI developments, SKT’s chief AI global officer highlighted the company’s goal to “redefine our relationship with our customers with new technology like AI” with the help of the company’s own AI assistance service A. (pronounced A dot).

According to Chung, SKT is looking to set up a new business model beyond its existing telco business, by applying AI and introducing new services based on the technology.

“AI can increase our internal efficiencies and that will definitely cut the cost of our operation. [The] telecom [industry] has a huge spending, huge cost for our operation, like customer service or network monitoring. So, if we successfully apply AI technology on these use cases, it definitely decreases our cost,” he explained.

Chung also shared insights about the challenges that SKT faces on its AI-driven journey and addressed concerns about the impact the technology will have on jobs and how the company works with its alliance partners to ensure the responsible use of AI.

In addition to SK Telecom and Nokia, the alliance includes quantum VPN provider Xgate, hardware-based cryptographic module specialist KCS, quantum communication solutions company IDQ Korea, SOS Lab and Wooriro as its members.

In a translated statement, the South Korean operator explained the companies involved possess “key technologies and components in the quantum field”, and a joint brand is set to launch in the first half of 2024 to confirm an official name for the group.

The alliance’s key focuses include exploring joint business opportunities, the promotion of investments across global companies and the establishment of a consultative body charged with overseeing the performance of the quantum alliance.

There are also plans to participate in domestic and international exhibitions to encourage competitiveness of quantum innovations and services, as well as introduce the technology to new markets through B2B and public-private partnerships.

"SK Telecom, IDQ et al form Quantum Alliance","SK Telecom, IDQ et al form the Quantum Alliance","SK Telecom has teamed up with Nokia and five other partners to form the Quantum Alliance, which aims to develop a quantum technology ecosystem in South Korea initially, and then look abroad for international opportunities.

That’s a model – develop locally, take global – that SK Telecom has already adopted with its metaverse and AI developments – see MWC24: SKT’s Suk Geun Chung on global AI ambitions and News brief: SKT further expands its metaverse reach.

The companies involved are those with “key technologies and components in the quantum field”, namely SOS Lab, Xgate, Wooriro, KCS, and IDQ Korea (the local branch of quantum cybersecurity company ID Quantique), in addition to SKT and Nokia.

SOS Lab is a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) specialist while Xgate is a developer of quantum-secure virtual private network (VPN) server technology that has already worked with SK Telecom on a trial of a quantum-safe VPN connection. Wooriro is a leading developer of single photon detection devices (SPADs) that can be used in quantum key distribution (QKD) applications, while KCS develops hardware-based cryptographic modules.

IDQ is a world-leading developer of quantum-secure technology: Founded in 2011, it has more than a decade of experience in QKD distribution systems, quantum-safe network encryption, single photon counters and quantum random number generators. It has long been a partner to Nokia and is involved in many telecom sector QKD and quantum-safe communications developments around the world, having partnered with the likes of Singtel in Singapore, Proximus in Belgium, Deutsche Telekom in Germany, and many more.

The alliance members plan to develop joint business and marketing opportunities (with public and national projects a priority), create a consultative body and seek investment opportunities. They also plan to develop “differentiated products” and add additional companies to the group as investments by private companies and governments around the world start to grow: According to the Korea Intelligence and Information Society Agency, the global quantum sector is set to grow in value from $19.6bn last year to $117.9bn by 2030.

“The establishment of this Quantum Alliance will lay the foundation for strengthening the competitiveness of the domestic quantum industry,” stated Ha Min-yong, SKT’s global solutions office manager. “We will continue to cooperate with leading domestic and foreign quantum companies to build on the alliance’s success stories… create a new business and, based on this, we will push for entry into the global market.”

The formation of the alliance is just SK Telecom’s latest effort to develop a leading position in the quantum technology and quantum-secure networking sector. In September last year, SK Telecom used an ITU security group meeting that was being hosted in South Korea to push for the development of global quantum-safe communications standards based on a combination of QKD and post-quantum cryptography (PQC) technologies; and in mid-2022, the company, which now positions itself as an AI company rather than a telco, received approval for its technologies to be adopted as international standards for quantum cryptography communication networks – see SK Telecom leaps closer to the quantum technology era.

The new collective won’t be called the Quantum Alliance for long – a new brand will be decided upon in the coming months. The name Quantum Alliance has been used previously by SK Telecom for a collaboration with Deutsche Telekom that was announced in 2017, while the the Quantum Alliance Initiative was initiated in 2018 to “develop and champion policies that allow the US and its allies to win the race to a universal quantum computer, while simultaneously working to ensure that both will be safe from a future quantum computer cyberattack within five years.”

"Telecom business alone is no longer lucrative, says SK Telecom CEO","Telecom business alone is no longer lucrative, says SK Telecom CEO","Developing AI technologies — AI data centers, large language models and AI chips — are essential for the domestic telecommunications industry to survive and thrive in the future, according to SK Telecom CEO Ryu Young-sang on Tuesday.

“SK Telecom is working to integrate AI in all realms of business and establish the needed infrastructure,” Ryu said at an event dubbed “The future trajectory of ICT in the AI era” held at Yonsei University, western Seoul. “The company will aim to become a global market leader in the AI industry and pave the way for Korea to become an advanced nation in the realm.”

The event was co-organized by Yonsei University and Barun ICT Research Center, and sponsored by mobile carrier SK Telecom.

Other panelists invited to the roundtable event agreed that mobile carriers can no longer depend on the telecom business alone to survive.

“What is evident is that mobile carriers no longer consider the telecommunications business alone to be lucrative,” said economics professor Kwon Nam-hoon of Konkuk University. “The proportion of revenue the business represents for the three major mobile carriers is between 20 and 40 percent, and their major cash cows are unrelated to the telecom business.”

Kwon forecasts that the next killer application as revolutionary as Apple’s first smartphone will most likely arrive in the form of personal AI assistants, and telecom companies will play a key role.

“AI personal assistants will become the users’ avatar,” Kwon said. “They will come in the form of connected personal devices that users carry around, and when telecom companies provide that, it will be as revolutionary as the introduction of the iPhone.”

SK Telecom is considered to be at the forefront of the hyped technology among the three companies.

Ryu said last year that his firm aims to become a global AI company and generate annual revenue of 25 trillion won ($18.7 billion) from AI ventures by 2028.

He put a particular emphasis on the eventual evolution of A dot, SK’s Korean large language model and the name of its AI app, into a personal AI assistant, which he believes will become one of the most pursued realms of business in the AI era.

Experts were unanimous in the viewpoint that it will be difficult for Korean tech companies to directly compete against globally dominant players such as OpenAI and Google, but they can at least grow to the level where they can monitor global policies and become alternative solutions.

“Telecom policies on the integration of AI technology will be enforced under a universal set of rules that will be applied to all countries,” said Kim Kyung-man, head of telecommunications policy at the Ministry of Science and ICT. “It will be important for Korean companies to get their hands on imported technologies first and set up the physical infrastructure so that new services can instantly be applied domestically.”

With the advancement of AI, the metaverse will be back, according to Kwon.

“There is a desire among people to create a virtual self, an anonymous self-being on social media,” Kwon said. “AI will make this possible with a higher-dimensional being on the floor of the metaverse, and it will be another potential profit-making sector for telecom companies to enter.” Korea Joongang Daily",https://www.communicationstoday.co.in/telecom-business-alone-is-no-longer-lucrative-says-sk-telecom-ceo/,"Telecom business alone is no longer lucrative, says SK Telecom CEO ...

– SK Telecom Co., South Korea’s top mobile carrier, sees the emergence of personal artificial intelligence assistants as a game changer in the AI industry, which is expected to bring opportunities for telecommunications service providers in the sector currently dominated by Big Tech companies, its CEO said.“That is the future that A. is dreaming of,” SK Telecom CEO Ryu Young-Sang told reporters on Monday, referring to the company’s AI service, on the sidelines of the Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2024, the world’s top telecommunications technology event, in Barcelona. “That will create a huge market.”“We have yet to develop a perfect game changer service with A. ,” Ryu said. “But we are preparing a separate personal AI assistant service for the global market.”The comments came as SK Telecom aims to transform itself into an AI company from a mobile carrier. Ryu said major global tech giants will not necessarily dominate the personal AI assistant sector, adding startups or telcos could develop such game changers.He hoped SK Telecom’s global AI joint venture partners with heavyweights such as Europe’s largest telecommunication service provider Deutsche Telekom AG to co-develop personal AI assistants.Earlier in the day, SK Telecom, Deutsche Telekom, SoftBank Group Corp., Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. (SingTel) and the United Arab Emirates’ e& agreed to establish a joint venture to develop large language models (LLMs), specifically tailored to the needs of telecommunication companies. “I expect the LLMs to achieve a level by which not only SK Telecom but also the GTAA founding members can use them within this year,” Ryu said. The South Korean company set up the Global Telco AI Alliance (GTAA) in July 2023 with Deutsche Telekom, SingTel and e&.The four telecommunications service providers with a combined 1.3 billion users worldwide aim to expand the GTAA.“It is a key to attract more telecommunications service operators to the GTAA. We can target up to triple digits,” Ryu said, although he thinks the GTAA should have only one member company per country.Ryu emphasized the importance of LLMs for specific industries.“The gap is expected to significantly widen between operators that are in industries creating vertical LLMs and those that are not,” he said, referring to language models that undergo specialized training in a specific domain or industry.“Once we create a vertical LLM through the alliance, we can change the entire landscape and gain the upper hand in competition with other industries.”Ryu expected AI data center and semiconductor companies to cash in on rapid growth in the intelligence of machines and software market.SK Telecom is accelerating its AI data center business while hoping Sapeon Inc. , spun off from the mobile carrier, develops AI semiconductors.“The AI data center market will be explosive,” Ryu said. “We may start a visible AI data center service in Korea within this year.”“Demand for Sapeon’s NPUs is predicted to grow if the AI sector focuses more on reasoning in the future,” he added, referring to neural processing units.Ji-Eun Jeong at jeong@hankyung.com Jongwoo Cheon edited this article.",https://www.kedglobal.com/artificial-intelligence/newsView/ked202402270013,"SK Telecom sees rise of personal AI assistants as game changer · SK Telecom

"Humane reveals first international market for the Ai Pin, partnering with 
South Korea's SK Telecom","Humane reveals first international market for the Ai Pin, partnering with 
South Korea's SK Telecom","Hyped hardware startup Humane has announced plans for its first international market, inking a deal with South Korean carrier SK Telecom.

The announcement comes shortly after the San Francisco-based company revealed it was pushing back the shipping date of its Ai Pin device from March to mid-April in its domestic U.S. market.

Founded in 2017 by former Apple executives Bethany Bongiorno and Imran Chaudhri, Humane had raised north of $200 million from backers including Microsoft, Qualcomm Ventures and OpenAI’s Sam Altman before anyone in the outside world knew what it was building. The company finally revealed all last June, and in the intervening months it teased more details about the device.

In a nutshell, Humane has created the “Ai Pin,” a wearable device and whole new form factor packed with sensors, generative AI smarts and a mini projector that beams information onto any surface.

The Ai Pin costs $699, with a recurring $24 monthly subscription that gives the user a phone number and unlimited data to power as many AI-powered queries they like. This positions Humane as a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), with T-Mobile serving as its launch partner in the U.S. market.

Delays

However, while Humane has given the world glimpses of the Ai Pin, nothing has yet left the factory floor for the consumer market — and with the company announcing a round of layoffs in January, with long-standing CTO Patrick Gates also leaving his role, it would be easy to think that something wasn’t quite right at the company.

But with a South Korea launch now on the agenda, in partnership with the country’s largest mobile provider, this bodes well for Humane as it ramps up production in the coming months. The partnership also extends beyond a simple MVNO tie-up — Humane says it’s part of a “strategic investment opportunity” that will see SK Telecom license Humane’s CosmOS, the proprietary AI-enabled operating system that powers the Ai Pin.

Indeed, SK Telecom has been bolstering its very own AI offerings of late, launching a ChatGPT competitor of sorts back in 2022 called A.Dot, and late last year it revealed its ambitions to become a “global AI company” through establishing partnerships with different players around the world. And just yesterday, SK Telecom announced a partnership with AI search engine Perplexity to bring its premium “Pro” plan to SK Telecom’s 32 million subscribers.

It’s not entirely clear to what extent SK Telecom might lean on CosmOS, but the announcement today said that the two companies will “collaborate on new subscription offerings and create new revenue opportunities for an app-less OS and ecosystem” for the Korean market.

It’s also not yet clear when the Ai Pin might make it to market in South Korea, but given the delays currently surrounding its U.S. launch, we maybe shouldn’t expect it too soon.",https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/27/humane-announces-first-international-market-for-its-ai-pin-partnering-with-south-koreas-sk-telecom/,"Hyped AI startup Humane has announced plans for its first international

"SK Telecom, global telcos to form language-model joint venture","SK Telecom, global telcos to form language-model joint venture","SK Telecom, Korea's top mobile carrier, said Monday it will create a joint venture with four global mobile carriers aimed at developing large language models (LLMs) tailored to the needs of telecommunications companies.

The joint venture will be established by SK Telecom, Germany's Deutsche Telekom, the United Arab Emirates' e& Group, Singapore's Singtel and Japan's Softbank later this year, according to the Korean company.

The plan was announced during the Global Telco AI Alliance's inaugural meeting held at the Mobile World Congress Barcelona 2024.

SK Telecom said the joint venture will develop LLMs that can help telcos improve their customer interactions via digital assistants and chatbots.

The companies aim to develop multilingual LLMs optimized for languages including Korean, English, German, Arabic and Japanese, with plans for additional languages to be agreed on among the founding members.

The envisioned LLMs will likely help the joint venture to reach a global customer base of approximately 1.3 billion across 50 countries, including SK Telecom's some 31 million subscribers and Deutsche Telekom's 250 million subscriptions, according to the Korean company.

南韓SK電訊攜手美企Perplexity 提供AI搜尋引擎服務,South Korea's SK Telecom joins hands with US company Perplexity to provide AI search engine services,"路透周一 (26 日) 報導，南韓最大的電信公司 SK 電訊 (SK Telecom) 與美國人工智慧 (AI) 新創公司 Perplexity 合作，為其用戶提供基於 AI 的搜尋引擎，作為 Google 的替代品。

兩家公司表示，透過此次合作，SK 電訊的用戶將可以免費使用 Perplexity 的付費版本，SK 電訊則可以使用 Perplexity 的專有模式來建立能夠存取即時資訊的個人 AI 助理產品。

電訊的投資團隊受訪時表示，雙方合作的細節，包括向公司用戶推出 Perplexity Pro 版本的時間，仍有待敲定。

兩家公司還補充說，SK 電訊沒有排除與 Perplexity 投資或成立合資企業的可能性，因此合作的資金規模可能會擴大。

Perplexity 執行長 Aravind Srinivas 在受訪時表示：「這是一個雙贏的局面，因為 SK 電訊正在為他們的用戶提供更多的增值服務，而我們正在通過他們的行銷管道接觸到他們的用戶。」

身為 Google 搜尋的挑戰者，Perplexity AI 使用生成式 AI 模型來回答使用者的問題，同時提供資訊來源。該公司上個月從輝達 (NVDA-US) 和亞馬遜 (AMZN-US) 創始人貝佐斯等投資人募集 7,360 萬美元。這輪融資由風險投資公司 IVP 領投，對該公司的估值約為 5.2 億美元。

Similarweb 的數據顯示，去年 12 月位於加州舊金山的 Perplexity 網站和行動網站的瀏覽量達 4,560 萬次。該公司提供免費版和付費版，向用戶每月收取 20 美元，無限制搜尋。

SK 電訊一直在與矽谷新創公司合作，以獲取尖端技術並探索使用生成 AI。該公司去年宣布向美國 AI 模型製造商 Anthropic 投資 1 億美元，共同開發電信業的大型語言模型。

Joint Venture Company to be established within this year

Initial fine-tuning of models takes place

BARCELONA, Spain, Feb. 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- SK Telecom (NYSE:SKM, ""SKT""), Deutsche Telekom, e& Group, Singtel and SoftBank Corp. today held the inaugural meeting of the Global Telco AI Alliance (GTAA) at MWC Barcelona 2024 and announced their plans to establish a joint venture.

The meeting was attended by SK's Chairman Chey Tae-won, SKT's CEO Ryu Young-sang, Deutsche Telekom's CEO Tim Höttges and DT's Board Member for Technology & Innovation, Claudia Nemat, e& Group's Group CEO Hatem Dowidar, Singtel Group's CEO Yuen Kuan Moon, and SoftBank's CISO Tadashi Iida.

Through the Joint Venture Company, the five companies plan to develop Large Language Models (LLMs) specifically tailored to the needs of telecommunications companies (telcos). The LLMs will be designed to help telcos improve their customer interactions via digital assistants and chatbots.

The goal is to develop multilingual LLMs optimized for languages including Korean, English, German, Arabic and Japanese, with plans for additional languages to be agreed among the founding members.

The joint venture plans to focus on deploying innovative AI applications tailored to the needs of the Global AI Telco Alliance members in their respective markets, enabling them to reach a global customer base of approximately 1.3 billion across 50 countries. Deutsche Telekom boasts about 250 million subscribers across 12 countries, including Germany and the U.S. The e& Group has 169 million subscribers in 16 countries across the Middle East, Asia, and Africa, while the Singtel Group has 770 million subscribers in 21 countries, including Australia, India, and Indonesia.

The Joint Venture Company will be established within this year.

Compared to general LLMs, telco-specific LLMs are more attuned to the telecommunications domain and better at understanding user intent. By making it easier for telcos to deploy high-quality generative AI models swiftly and efficiently, telco-specific LLMs are expected to help accelerate AI transformation of various telco business and services, including customer service.

The LLMs are currently being optimized. Telcos' customer service data is used to fine-tune the model for telco-specific questions. This is because tariff and contract models, information on special hardware such as the router, for example (e.g. How do I do a reset?) are rarely found in the general training data of the large models. But it's exactly this content that a telco bot needs to know. So that it is able to understand, summarize and respond to these specific concerns.

This targeted training ensures the LLM understands the unique language and needs of telecom operators, paving the way for enhanced, personalized, and efficient customer experiences.

""We as telcos need to develop tailored LLM for the telco industry to make telco operations more efficient, which is a low-hanging fruit. Our ultimate goal is to discover new business models by redefining relationships with customers. The Global Telco AI Alliance brings synergy to its members by allowing them to achieve more by working as a team,"" said Ryu Young-sang, CEO of SKT.

""We want our customers to experience the best possible service. AI helps us do that. Already today, more than 100,000 customer service dialogs a month in Germany are handled by Generative AI. By integrating telco-specific large language models, our 'Frag Magenta' chatbot becomes even more human-centric: AI personalizes conversations between customers and chatbots. And our joint venture brings Europe and Asia closer together,"" said Claudia Nemat, Board Member Deutsche Telekom for Technology and Innovation.

""This is a monumental step for e& and for the Telco industry at large. From streamlining customer support interactions to enabling personalised recommendations, this multi-lingual LLM will revolutionise how businesses engage with customers"", said Dena Almansoori, Group Chief AI and Data Officer, e& group. ""In collaboration with our Global AI Telco Alliance partners, we look forward to shaping both the present and future of customer engagement and setting new standards for efficiency and innovation across the telecommunications landscape to better serve our customers and create meaningful impact.""

""This promises to be a game changer not just for us at Singtel but for any telecom company out there looking to lift their customer experience beyond limited automated responses and generic chatbot interactions. This multi-lingual LLM tailored for telcos will greatly expand chatbot capabilities with relevant responses to customers' technical queries, freeing up service agents to deal with more complex customer issues and we intend to deploy this across the Singtel Group. With leading telcos from three different continents working on this innovative model, this unprecedented effort to scale AI development for the telecom industry would not have been possible had we all decided to go it alone,"" said Yuen Kuan Moon, Group Chief Executive Officer, Singtel.

""Through a powerful alliance with industry leaders, we embark on a mission to revolutionize global communication, elevate service quality, and ignite a new era of technological innovation powered by AI. Together, we have the power to shape the future of telecommunications, empowering communities worldwide with seamless connectivity and boundless opportunities,"" said Hideyuki Tsukuda, Executive Vice President & CTO of SoftBank Corp.

Perplexity, the company behind the answer engine of the same name, has revealed that it’s partnering with South Korea’s SK Telecom and will give the carrier’s 32.5 million customers free access to Perplexity Pro, which usually costs $20 per month.

For those that have never tried Perplexity, the service can be best described as an answer engine. You type in your query and Perplexity searches the web for you and gives you a ChatGPT-like response based on the web results it found. The app is so helpful that even NVIDIA’s Jensen Huang has admitted to using the service every day to research information.

Perplexity can be used for free by everyone but by subscribing to the Pro version you get unlimited Copilot queries (these are more refined searches), unlimited file uploads, the ability to use different AI models including GPT-4 and Claude 2.1, and API credits.

As part of the deal between the two companies, SKT will work with Perplexity to develop new AI tools that use Perplexity’s Online LLMs which get the latest info from the net and respond to time-sensitive queries.

Commenting on the partnership, Chung Suk-geun, Chief AI Global Officer at SKT, said:

“We are united in a shared vision of using AI to redefine how we interact with the world, and we were immediately impressed with the speed, accuracy, and reliability of Perplexity’s answer engine. SKT is thrilled to be bringing Perpexity’s innovative capabilities to all users, creating an unparalleled experience for our customers. This is just the start of our collaboration, and we see lots of opportunities for this to not only impact the Korean market, but also Internet users globally.”

Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas said that telecom partnerships are a core part of its global growth strategy. He also said that SKT is the company’s first global partner and a first-of-its-kind partnership between a mobile carrier and an AI company.

By placing Perplexity Pro in the hands of another 32 million customers it will help Perplexity find a new audience. As more users learn about this service, it could become a dangerous competitor to Google’s search business.

Through the Joint Venture Company, the five companies plan to develop Large Language Models (LLMs) specifically tailored to the needs of telecommunications companies (telcos). The LLMs will be designed to help telcos improve their customer interactions via digital assistants and chatbots.

The goal is to develop multilingual LLMs optimized for languages including Korean, English, German, Arabic and Japanese, with plans for additional languages to be agreed among the founding members.

""We want our customers to experience the best possible service. AI helps us do that. Already today, more than 100,000 customer service dialogs a month in Germany are handled by Generative AI. By integrating telco-specific large language models, our 'Frag Magenta' chatbot becomes even more human-centric: AI personalizes conversations between customers and chatbots. And our joint venture brings Europe and Asia closer together,” says Claudia Nemat, Member of the Board of Management for Technology and Innovation at Deutsche Telekom.

Compared to general LLMs, telco-specific LLMs are more attuned to the telecommunications domain and better at understanding user intent. By making it easier for telcos to deploy high-quality generative AI models swiftly and efficiently, telco-specific LLMs are expected to help accelerate AI transformation of various telco business and services, including customer service.

The joint venture plans to focus on deploying innovative AI applications tailored to the needs of the Global AI Telco Alliance members in their respective markets, enabling them to reach a global customer base of approximately 1.3 billion across 50 countries. Deutsche Telekom boasts about 250 million subscribers across 12 countries, including Germany and the U.S. The e& Group has 169 million subscribers in 16 countries across the Middle East, Asia, and Africa, while the Singtel Group has 770 million subscribers in 21 countries, including Australia, India, and Indonesia.

It is planned to establish the Joint Venture Company within this year.

Training of the model has already started

The LLMs are currently being optimized. For this purpose, the data from chats of the customer service were processed and, of course, pseudonomized. This ensures data protection-compliant use. This data is used to fine-tune the model for telco-specific questions. This is because tariff and contract models, information on special hardware such as the router, for example (e.g. How do I do a reset?) are rarely found in the general training data of the large models. But it's exactly this content that a telco bot needs to know. So that it is able to understand, summarize and respond to these specific concerns.

This targeted training ensures the LLM understands the unique language and needs of telecom operators, paving the way for enhanced, personalized, and efficient customer experiences.

Quotes from each company:

“We as telcos need to develop tailored LLM for the telco industry to make telco operations more efficient, which is a low-hanging fruit. Our ultimate goal is to discover new business models by redefining relationships with customers. The Global Telco AI Alliance brings synergy to its members by allowing them to achieve more by working as a team,” said Ryu Young-sang, CEO of SKT.

“This is a monumental step for e& and for the Telco industry at large. From streamlining customer support interactions to enabling personalised recommendations, this multi-lingual LLM will revolutionise how businesses engage with customers”, said Dena Almansoori, Group Chief AI and Data Officer, e& group. “In collaboration with our Global AI Telco Alliance partners, we look forward to shaping both the present and future of customer engagement and setting new standards for efficiency and innovation across the telecommunications landscape to better serve our customers and create meaningful impact.”

“This promises to be a game changer not just for us at Singtel but for any telecom company out there looking to lift their customer experience beyond limited automated responses and generic chatbot interactions. This multi-lingual LLM tailored for telcos will greatly expand chatbot capabilities with relevant responses to customers’ technical queries, freeing up service agents to deal with more complex customer issues and we intend to deploy this across the Singtel Group. With leading telcos from three different continents working on this innovative model, this unprecedented effort to scale AI development for the telecom industry would not have been possible had we all decided to go it alone."" Yuen Kuan Moon, Group Chief Executive Officer, Singtel.

“Through a powerful alliance with industry leaders, we embark on a mission to revolutionize global communication, elevate service quality, and ignite a new era of technological innovation powered by AI. Together, we have the power to shape the future of telecommunications, empowering communities worldwide with seamless connectivity and boundless opportunities,” said Hideyuki Tsukuda, Executive Vice President & CTO of SoftBank Corp.

DOCOMO and NTT team up with SK Telecom and Rohde & Schwarz for 6G research,DOCOMO and NTT team up with SK Telecom and Rohde & Schwarz for 6G research,"News

The two new partners join existing collaborators Fujitsu, NEC, Nokia, Ericsson, and Keysight Technologies

There is little doubt that 6G is still many years from commercial reality, but interest in the nascent technology is nonetheless growing steadily throughout the telecoms ecosystem.

This week, Japanese telecoms giants NTT DOCOMO and NTT have announced that their pool of 6G research partners is growing, with South Korean operator SK Telecom and electronics testing specialist Rohde & Schwarz stepping into the fold.

The new partners will help collaborate on various 6G trials currently taking place in Japan focussed on exploring potential frequency bands for the new technology. More specifically, SK Telcom will join an existing trial by DOCOMO, NTT, and Nokia aiming to explore the use of AI to “tailor radio interfaces for various propagation environments”.

A press release from Nokia gave further detail, describing the collaboration as focussing on developing a ‘6G AI-native air interface (AI-AI), a critical next-generation technology that could greatly boost network performance while increasing energy efficiency’. This includes created a future proof-of-concept for 6G AI-AI systems, which can then be tested under real-world conditions.

“For Nokia to create a world-class 6G system, it’s critical we get input from the service providers that will one day deploy 6G. SKT, NTT and DOCOMO are among the most innovative service providers in the world, which gives us the perfect partners to design the networks of the future,” explained Peter Vetter, President of Bell Labs Core Research at Nokia.

Given SK Telecom’s ambition of transforming from a telco to an AI company, their interest in this project with Nokia and the Japanese operators is hardly surprising.

Rohde & Schwarz, meanwhile, will use their measurement-system design technology to evaluate wireless-sensing solutions in real-world environments.

DOCOMO and NTT are already conducting various 6G spectrum trials with Fujitsu, NEC, Nokia, Ericsson, and Keysight Technologies, aiming to play a integral role in the development and standardisation of the 6G technology.

Nokia, for example, has already conducted successful beamforming trials in the 140GHz band, with the next steps set to explore more specific applications using sub-terahertz spectrum in indoor environment. Fujitsu, on the other hand, has been trialling distributed MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) technology in the 100GHz and 300GHz bands.

"SK Telecom, NTT Docomo unveil technical outlook on vRAN","SK Telecom, NTT Docomo unveil technical outlook on vRAN","A new, joint white paper reviews the future prospects of vRAN base station equipment for use by telecommunications operators

Japanese operator NTT Docomo and South Korean carrier SK Telecom have released a white paper summarizing the technical outlook for base station equipment using virtualization technology.

The two Asian carriers said that this white paper is the latest result of their ongoing technical cooperation.

The white paper reviews the future prospects of virtualized RAN (vRAN) base station equipment for use by telecommunications operators, drawing on the two companies’ combined experience in the fields of network construction and operation. In addition to outlining expectations for base station equipment vendors, the white paper also discusses technical insights targeted at telecom carriers.

One of the two main themes of the white paper is the direction of technological advancements that are critical to the introduction of vRAN base station equipment, including three future requirements:

-Increased processing capacity and reduced power consumption.

-Early implementation of key virtualization capabilities, including resource pooling, scaling, and auto-healing.

-Enhanced integration technology and tools for vRAN base station equipment.

Both operators also highlighted that the other main theme focuses on accelerator technologies for signal processing required to implement vRAN base station equipment, including technical analysis on capacity, power consumption and complexity according to different accelerator structures and network architectures based on proprietary studies.

“This white paper represents a significant milestone based on the strong collaboration between our two companies, building upon our joint publication last year on Green Mobile Networks and 6G Requirements white papers. We will continue our collaboration with global leading operators like Docomo to prepare for the evolution towards future networks.” said Yu Takki, VP and head of SK Telecom’s Infra Tech Office.

Docomo and SK Telecom signed a cooperation agreement in November 2022 to advance technology studies of next-generation telecommunications infrastructure for 5G Evolution and 6G. As part of this deal, NTT Docomo and SK Telecom had said they plan to align their “concepts and timelines” for the early deployment of future 6G systems, through joint research and development as well as standardization

In February 2023, they jointly released two white papers on power-saving technologies for mobile networks and related technologies, as well as 6G requirements.

Going forward, the pair said they will continue their technical cooperation in various fields, including improving the competitiveness and operational efficiency of 5G and international standardization and technology verification for future 6G systems.",https://www.rcrwireless.com/20240221/network-infrastructure/sk-telecom-ntt-docomo-unveil-white-paper-vran,"The white paper reviews the future prospects of virtualized RAN (vRAN) base

(SK Telecom)

SK Telecom said Tuesday that it has jointly released a technical white paper with Japan's No. 1 mobile operator, NTT Docomo, for the adoption of the virtualized Radio Access Network.

The joint white paper, titled “Key Considerations for vRAN,” marks two years of cooperation on the metaverse, mobile network infrastructure and media business since the two companies signed a memorandum of understanding in November 2022.

VRAN, a technology that incorporates various network functions of radio access network equipment in software form, is intended to meet the telecom industry’s growing need for the advancement of 5G and the standardization of future networks like 6G.

Virtual base stations are a core element of open RAN and an essential technology in the process of 5G advancement and 6G standard establishment.

""This meaningful white paper reflects practical considerations and efforts for the development of core areas of Open RAN from the perspective of operators,"" Vice President and Head of Infra Tech Office of SKT Yu Tak-ki said. ""We plan to continue leading the global open RAN ecosystem through close collaboration with global operators.""

Unlike traditional base stations, which require matching hardware and software manufacturers, vRAN offers the advantage of being implementable with only necessary software installed on universal servers.

As vRAN still has room for improvement in capacity and power consumption compared to conventional base stations, the paper outlines essential elements required for enhancing the performance of vRAN — such as advancements in hardware accelerator technology, development of specialized virtualization techniques and considerations for evolving toward 6G.

The telecom giants foresee advancements in hardware accelerator technology, a critical component of vRAN, which will improve cell capacity and power consumption of vRAN through various evolutionary directions such as accelerator-embedded CPUs and in-line accelerators.

Meanwhile, SK Telecom and NTT Docomo plan to leverage insights from the white paper during discussions at the upcoming MWC Barcelona 2024 trade show, aiming to stimulate the global open RAN ecosystem.",https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20240220050541,"SK Telecom said Tuesday that it has jointly released a technical white

"What’s up with… Orange, Ericsson, SK Telecom","What’s up with… Orange, Ericsson, SK Telecom","In today’s industry news roundup: Orange grows its revenues in 2023 and highlights business unit turnaround; Ericsson unveils a slew of hardware and software products ahead of Mobile World Congress; SK Telecom works with chip and AI partners on smartphone power-saving tech advances; and much more!

Orange has booked modest growth in revenues and earnings for 2023, but has notably managed to reduce its annual operating costs by around €300m, half of the total it was aiming to save by the end of 2025. The telco group’s overall revenues in 2023 were up 1.8% year on year to €44.1bn, an increase of €790m, driven by a 3.5% rise in retail services and a 7.3% increase in equipment sales. On a geographical basis, the company’s best-performing region was the Middle East and Africa (MEA), where revenue grew by 11.4% to €7.2bn in 2023. Orange CEO Christel Heydemann attributed the rise to growth in mobile data, Orange Money and business-to-business activities. She also noted the company’s “solid performance” in Europe, where the region booked a modest 2.2% increase in revenues to €11.6bn, mainly driven by gains made in Poland, Belgium and Luxembourg. Spain brought in year-on-year growth for the first time since 2018, with a 1.1% rise in revenue to €4.7bn. Heydemann expressed confidence that the proposed €18.6bn merger deal with MásMóvil in the country will be approved by the European Commission, ahead of a decision expected by 22 February. In its domestic market of France, Orange saw its revenues decline 1.4% to €17.7bn. However, Heydemann noted that the transformation plan for Orange Business is delivering “encouraging initial results” with an improvement in the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation after leases (EBITDAaL) trend. Orange Business revenues were slightly up by 0.2% year on year to €7.9bn, with the main contributors, IT and integration services, growing by 6.3%, and mobile revenues up by 2.6%. These increases offset a decline in the voice and data legacy businesses, which dropped by 6.7% year on year. The company’s overall EBITDAaL for 2023 stood at €13bn, up 1.3% on 2022. Orange also noted that it managed to save some €300m despite inflation, mainly due to a headcount reduction as part of the French “part-time for seniors” agreement, and programmes targeting savings across purchasing, IT, networks and real estate. According to the company, it has retained a leadership position in convergence, boasting 11.9 million convergent customers group wide, up by 0.7% in 2023. “One year on from the announcement of our ‘Lead the Future’ strategic plan, we have achieved all our financial targets for 2023. These results are a testament to our ability to execute and advance our major strategic projects,” commented Heydemann. Find out more.

Ericsson launched a slew of new products on Thursday ahead of the upcoming MWC24 gathering in Barcelona at the end of February. The new launches included a range of radio products (all of which the vendor says are Open RAN-enabled), headed up by the AIR 3255, a massive MIMO time division duplex (TDD) radio that, the vendor claims, boasts a 20% lower embodied carbon footprint (related to greenhouse gas emissions that occur prior to first use of the product and throughout the process from raw material extraction up to final product delivery) and offers 25% lower power consumption compared with previous Ericsson radio products. The vendor also launched new software offerings, including its new Service Orchestration and Assurance stack, which is designed to enable network operators to orchestrate and manage services across multiple multivendor network domains in hybrid IT environments and which, the vendor notes, “works across network generations to efficiently coordinate service creation and management.” Ericsson also announced its Dynamic Network Slicing solution, which is based on the Service Orchestration and Assurance system. Telia’s group chief operating officer, Dr. Rainer Deutschmann, is keen on the Service Orchestration and Assurance product: “At Telia, we’re at a transition point within our transformation to industrialise our capabilities – transforming how we create, manage and monetise services. We’re pushing boundaries on the innovation front with our NorthStar programme enabling open innovation with industry partners. And the only way to be successful is if we force the need to simplify, standardise, and scale. Ericsson Service Orchestration and Assurance will help us get new, innovative services to market and to revenue quickly, reliably, and easily.”

And in more news from Ericsson…. Its Vonage division, which is developing a global platform that can expose network APIs to developers, is collaborating with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to combine the assets of the Vonage platform, the hyperscaler’s services and Ericsson’s 5G network capabilities to help “accelerate the availability of new solutions to millions of AWS developers through AWS Marketplace.” Niklas Heuveldop, the recently appointed CEO of Vonage, noted: “By working with AWS, we will accelerate our ability to embed communications and network APIs in applications and deliver new product offerings for AWS and Vonage customers.

SK Telecom (SKT) has developed an AI-based power-saving technology for smartphones together with chipmaker MediaTek and AI startup Nota AI. The on-device technology allows the handset to make real-time predictions about whether data transmission will occur within a certain period of time. As a result, it can control an “optimal connection status” between the device and the base station. When the technology predicts that data transmission is unlikely to occur, it will disconnect the smartphone from the base station to prevent unnecessary use of power. To develop this technology, the trio selected an “optimal AI model” and focused on making the model as lightweight as possible, using techniques such as “quantisation and pruning to enable low-latency and low-power operation on smartphones.” They then applied the lightweight AI model to a real smartphone modem to verify its real-time operation and to predict data transmission needs. The South Korean operator noted that it will introduce its R&D work at its MWC Barcelona 2024 booth and that it will continue to focus on improving the “completeness of the technology” by advancing AI models and testing network interworking. Find out more.

Telecom Italia (TIM) has reported a 3.2% year-on-year rise in group total revenues to €16.3bn in 2023. In its preliminary results, the telco stated that this growth was driven by improved performance in its Brazilian unit (total revenues were up by 10.7% year on year to €4.3bn), as well as gains made across its Enterprise unit (with total revenues up by 4.6% to €3bn), boosted by ICT revenues growth: Cloud services were 31% higher year on year, followed by internet of things (IoT) revenues that were up by 24%, and security services – up 11% from their 2022 levels. TIM also booked gains in NetCo, its domestic fixed line network business that is to be acquired by private equity firm KKR for €18.8bn, with total revenues up 3.7% year on year, though a specific figure has not been disclosed. The Italian operator further revealed that its capital expenditure (capex) stood at €4bn on a group level, of which €3.1bn was related to its domestic business. Net financial debt stood at €25.7bn by the end of December 2023, some €300m higher than in 2022. Alongside the results, TIM CEO Pietro Labriola has reportedly stated that the company does not expect any antitrust issues, which could impede the planned sale of NetCo, and that the deal would not create market concentration. The transaction is expected to be finalised by mid-2023.

German open-source software specialist SUSE has launched the latest version of its telco cloud stack, the Adaptive Telco Infrastructure Platform (ATIP), which has now reached its third iteration. The company says ATIP, which is designed for flexible and automated distributed network operations, has been enhanced following feedback from SUSE’s telco customers, as well as vendor partners such as Ericsson and Huawei. “The telco market is undergoing transformation, and our customers are responding to SUSE ATIP as it delivers on the promise of an adaptable platform for telecom operators,” stated Thomas Di Giacomo, chief technology and product officer at SUSE. “We are seeing adoption for a broad range of use cases across mobile and fixed networks, such as 5G packet core, cloud radio access network (RAN), fibre-to-the-home/building and others,” he added.

"China Mobile, SK Telecom put their own twist on innovation","China Mobile, SK Telecom put their own twist on innovation","Not many telcos would have put 'enter the Australian pet market' on their dance card for this year. But SK Telecom has crossed that marker, striking an agreement this week to supply its diagnostic tool, X Caliber, to Perth-based medical equipment firm ATX Medical.

X Caliber uses AI to analyze X-ray images of animals and deliver the result within 30 seconds, with a disease detection rate of around 85%. It's a cloud-based solution that requires no additional equipment and is accessible from any device.

It is just one small part of the grand AI design at SKT, probably the world's most AI-forward telco, which has adopted a 'pyramid' strategy encompassing AI infrastructure, transformation and services.

This approach is already impacting SKT's bottom line, though that’s mostly in its data center and cloud businesses rather than AI apps and services.

It has a pipeline of these, like its Korean-language contact center, AI chatbot and subscription service that it will soon start to roll out – but it will be some time before they can drive growth and profitability.

That's one version of Asian telco innovation in the 21st century. Then there's China Mobile, a state- and party-controlled entity where profitability is not always the priority.

Self-reliance

The big telco's reconfigurable 5G RF chip, announced six months ago, was chosen as one of China's top ten major government enterprise projects last year. As the first domestically developed reconfigurable chip for 5G, the Po Feng 8676 has strengthened China's 5G self-reliance, according to state-run news service CGTN.

Researcher Li Nan, who headed the chip project at the China Mobile Research Institute, has said the R&D team had proposed a reconfigurable architecture that would meet the ""application requirements of multi-band, multi-mode and multi-station"" wireless.

For operators everywhere else – Vietnam excepted – the idea of building core network chips, or any kind of advanced hardware, is way beyond scope.

But this project underlines China Mobile's broad remit, which is to aid industry development and carry out any task the government requires, whether that be to underwrite the development of a 3G technology or test out 6G satellite.

SK Telecom, South Korea’s largest telecom operator, ended Q4 2023 year with a total of 15.67 million subscribers in the 5G segment, up 17% from 13.4 million in the same period the previous year, the carrier said in its earnings statement.

During the fourth quarter of the year, the Korean carrier added nearly 524,000 5G subscribers. At the end of 2023, the operator’s 5G subscribers accounted for 68% of its overall handset subscribers, up from 58% at the end of December 2022.

In the LTE segment, SK Telecom ended the period with 15.07 million subscribers, down from 15.4 million in the previous quarter.

The Korean carrier ended last year with a total of 33.66 million mobile subscribers, up 2.5% year-on-year.

In Q4, SK Telecom’s net profit declined 16.2% year-on-year to KRW 187 billion ($140.3 million), while its revenue rose 3% year-on-year to KRW4.52 trillion.

“SK Telecom expects its AI businesses to achieve revenue growth based on strong AI infrastructure and technology capabilities it has built so far. AI data center, AI enterprise and AI semiconductor are expected to drive the growth of SK Telecom’s AI business by rapidly expanding sales this year with steep growth in market demand,” the telco said.

In September 2023, SK Telecom had announced its vision to become a global AI company and unveiled the AI Pyramid Strategy, under which it will strengthen its own competitiveness to deepen customer relationships while working together with partners throughout the world. The AI Pyramid Strategy focuses on innovating industry, society, and life centered around three key areas including AI Infrastructure, AI Transformation (AIX) and AI Service.

“In the area of AI Infrastructure, SK Telecom plans to secure and enhance infrastructure capabilities that serve as the foundation of an AI company, such as AI data centers, AI semiconductors, and multi-large language models (LLMs). AIX aims to innovate existing fixed and mobile telecommunications, media, and enterprise businesses through AI, and expand the application of AI to UAM and healthcare. Lastly, in the area of AI Service, SK Telecom plans to forge closer relationships with customers through a highly competent personal AI assistant and expand its scale by collaborating with global telecommunications companies,” the Korean telco had said.

“Going forward, based on its knowhow in operating various AI services, SK Telecom plans to expand its presence in the AI service market by simultaneously entering overseas markets in cooperation with members of the Global AI Telco Alliance,” the carrier added.

Last year, South Korea’s ICT ministry canceled a license owned by SK Telecom which had been meant to support 5G services via 28 GHz spectrum, citing a lack of deployment investment by the operator.

SK Telecom had been given the right to use the 28 GHz band in 2018 and was required to install a total of 15,000 units of network equipment by May 2023. However, SK Telecom had only installed only 1,650 units of 28 GHz equipment and had no plans for further installations, according to the Ministry of Science and ICT.",https://www.rcrwireless.com/20240206/5g/sk-telecom-ends-2023-15-million-5g-subscribers,"During the fourth quarter of the year, the Korean carrier added nearly

SK Telecom’s AI focus pays off in 2023,SK Telecom’s AI focus pays off in 2023,"SKT is confident that its AI-driven units will achieve revenue growth on the back of the “strong AI infrastructure and technology capabilities it has built so far”. Its AI business is expected to rapidly expand sales this year to meet “steep growth in market demand”, especially through the delivery of AI-powered datacentre services, enterprise services, semiconductor products, and the further development of AI applications. One such offering is the A. (pronounced A dot) virtual personal assistant, which it has been developing for several years now and which is gaining traction with end users: In the final quarter of 2023, A. achieved a staggering 300% growth in cumulative subscribers since its beta service launch in May 2022 (though actual user numbers were not shared).

The operator also expects to achieve “tangible results” in 2024 from its initiative to build telco-specific large language models (LLMs) through in-house development and cooperation with global tech companies and regional telco leaders, especially via the Global Telco AI Alliance that SKT helped to set up last year. Some of its partners in this effort include German telco giant Deutsche Telekom and generative AI (GenAI) platform developer Anthropic: SKT aims to monetise its LLM offerings as part of its global expansion plans.

And what about other parts of SKT’s empire? The influential South Korean operator has been one of the most bullish metaverse service developers in the world and has gained a lot of traction domestically and through international partnerships for its in-house developed platform ifland over the past couple of years. But SKT’s financial report shows that user engagement with ifland in South Korea may already be in decline. Having peaked at 4.2 million in mid-2023, the number of ifland monthly active users (MAUs) fell to 3.6 million during the final quarter of 2023.

Its 5G subscriber base, though, continues to grow and ended 2023 at 15.7 million, up 17% from the 13.4 million 5G subscribers it boasted at the end of 2022.

The company also reported more than 30% year-on-year growth in both datacentre and cloud revenues, to 202bn KRW ($152m) and 146bn KRW ($110m) respectively in 2023.

Another notable takeaway from SKT’s results shows that the telco invested less in its networks last year than the year before, in line with efforts by many other global operators looking to tighten their purse strings, with its capital expenditure (capex) down 9.6% to 2.74tn KRW ($2.05bn).

In its regulatory filing the company said sales for the quarter rose 3% to 4.53 trillion Korean won (US$3.4 billion dollars), with core MNO revenue up just 0.9% but with cloud and enterprise sales advancing strongly.

The biggest revenue surge came in data center and cloud on the back of AI demand, the company said. Full-year data center revenue rose 30% to 202 billion Korean won (US$150 million), while cloud sales spiked 37% to KRW146 billion ($109 million).

Over the full-year, net earnings rose 21% to KRW1.15 trillion ($860 million) and operating profit was up 8.8% on just 1.8% higher revenue. The company also kept a lid on costs, with opex nearly a percentage point below revenue growth, while capex was down 15.8% for the quarter and 9.6% for the full year.

SKT has set a revenue target of KRW17.9 trillion ($13.4 billion) for 2024, roughly 2% above 2023, CFO Kim Yang-sup said. With 5G accounting for two-thirds of mobile subscriptions, he said growth from the MNO business was inevitably slowing down.

Enhanced experience

He said the operator aimed to incorporate AI into its mobile and broadband offerings to optimize products and ensure high-quality customer service that would enhance customer experience.

The prime example was the AI assistant A. (known as A-dot), which had attracted 3.4 million subs since launch last September through functions including call summary, real-time interpretation and playlist creation.

""We believe that the success of A. is the result of continued effort to deliver value to customers by offering diverse useful services and features such as call recording and summary and sleep management,"" Kim said.

SKT is also developing telco-specific services using its large telco datasets, working with telco partners DT, Singtel and e&. ""It is our target to release commercial features that can be applied for AI contact centers and telco agents in the first half of this year,"" Kim said.

""We're currently working on commercializing AI tools that will effectively support localization and advancement of diverse telco-specific services through our own efforts and in cooperation with external partners,"" he added.

SK Telecom (SKT) has collaborated with Intel to successfully develop technology that can significantly reduce communication delays in 6G Core networks.

The Core network acts as the gateway for all voice and data traffic from a user’s mobile device to access the internet. As networks become more complex with 5G and 6G, communication delays within the Core network have increased, making it difficult to provide the speed and reliability needed for advanced services like AI.

The new Inline Service Mesh technology, created by SKT and Intel – utilising Intel Xeon processors with built-in AI capabilities – can increase communication speeds within the Core network by reducing latency between components by up to 70 percent without the need for proxies.

“This will allow AI requiring large amounts of computation to be applied to the Core network in more areas,” said Yu Takki, VP and Head of Infra Tech at SKT.

SKT says it has already used similar concepts to cut wireless resource usage by 40 percent and improve connectivity for users by analysing real-time movement patterns.

By reducing delays, the two companies estimate the new technology can improve service efficiency by 33 percent for 6G Core networks. This will be vital to enable the high flexibility, safety, and intelligence required for 6G services.

The technology will be tested in commercial equipment by next year. SKT and Intel have collaborated for over a decade on developing key mobile communication technologies together.

“Our research with SK Telecom continues to deliver innovations deployed worldwide,” said Dan Rodriguez, Corporate VP at Intel. “By using the latest Intel Xeon processors, we drive performance and efficiency vital to future core networks.”

The two companies plan to continue working together to incorporate AI technology to further improve traffic processing in core networks. This will help to ensure SKT maintains leadership in 6G networked services.

A technical whitepaper has been published by the partners that describes the new technology in detail.

Korean telco SK Telecom announced that, in collaboration with Intel, it has successfully developed technology to reduce communication delays necessary for the evolution of a 6G core architecture.

In a release, the Asian carrier explained that the core network is the gateway through which all voice and data traffic generated from a customer’s mobile device passes through to access the Internet network, adding that it is a mobile communication service system that is responsible for security and service quality through the inter-connection of various systems.

SK Telecom also noted that the 6G core architecture will be required to have higher flexibility and safety than previous generations of communications and to provide stable AI service quality and technologies to customers by embedding intelligent and automation technologies.

“As network complexity continues to increase, the process of sending and receiving messages is frequently recreated. Therefore, communication delays will increase compared to before. It is difficult to address these limitations with communication standard technologies for interconnection between unit functions within the existing Core network,” SK Telekom said.

Inline Service Mesh, a technology the two companies developed utilizing Intel Xeon processors with built in AI, is capable of increasing the communication speed within the core network by reducing latency between unit functions without proxy, according to the company.

Through this technology development, AI, which requires a large amount of computation, can be applied to the core network in a wider variety of models. SK Telecom has already commercialized a technology that reduces wireless resources by 40% and improves connectivity by analyzing movement patterns of real users in real time. Through this cooperation, the two companies say they will be able to reduce communication delays by 70% and increase service efficiency by 33% in the core network through the application of the 6G core architecture.

The Korean telco said it aims to apply the results of this study to commercial equipment next year. A technical white paper has been published that describes the technology, development process and benefits, the carrier said.

Based on the results of this study, SK Telecom and Intel plan to continue research and development for traffic processing improvement technologies incorporating AI technology in various areas of the core network.

“We have made another technical achievement through continuous technology development cooperation with Intel to secure leadership in 6G,” said Yu Takki, vice president and head of infra tech at SK Telecom. “We will continue our research and make efforts to commercialize AI-based 6G core architecture.”

“Our research and development efforts with SK Telecom continue to deliver innovations that have been deployed by communications service providers worldwide”, said Dan Rodriguez, corporate vice president of Intel Network & Edge Solutions Group. “By leveraging the latest Intel Xeon processors with built in AI features, our companies are able to drive both performance and efficiency improvements that will be vital to the future core networks.

SK Telecom had previously released a 6G white paper that focuses on the key requirements for 6G standardization and the telco’s views regarding the direction of future network evolution.

The Korean carrier said the new white paper contains its views on 6G key requirements and 6G evolution methodology, along with its opinions on the latest trends in frequency standardization. The 6G white paper also provides analysis, development directions and methodologies pertaining to promising 6G use cases, technology trends as well as and candidate frequencies.",https://www.rcrwireless.com/20240202/6g/sk-telecom-develops-key-tech-6g-evolution-intel,"SK Telecom and Intel developed Inline Service Mesh utilizing Intel Xeon

South Korea’s information and communications technology (ICT) major SK Telecom Co. has developed a new technology jointly with US tech giant Intel Corp. that is expected to bring forward the 6G network era, the company announced on Thursday.Tests conducted by SK Telecom and Intel showed that the so-called inline service mesh technology reduced latency overhead in data transactions by 70% and gateway central processing unit (CPU) use by 33% on 6G core architecture, SK Telecom said.The new inline approach enables network communication between modules without proxies, resulting in faster core network traffic processing and higher efficiency in processing massive volumes of data, according to a White Paper titled “Toward 6G architecture using an inline service mesh,” published on Jan. 24, 2024.SK Telecom and Intel expect such a low-latency service mesh to usher in the 6G era earlier than expected with further improvement.The low-latency service is expected to significantly enhance network traffic processing on bare metal-based cloud native 6G core architecture, highly touted as the next-generation wireless network that can be powered by AI.A core network is a gateway between end users and the internet network, designed to enable network traffic at high speeds.Bare metal cloud native refers to an advanced technology developed to lighten the system so that the operating system is not duplicated between hardware resources and virtual resources in the cloud.Bare metal cloud native architecture allows cloud native applications to be deployed in containers running directly on the bare metal cloud, which radically simplifies network implementation.As the core network advances, the wireless network becomes increasingly complex, delaying communication in the network.But SK Telecom and Intel expect the newly discovered inline service mesh technology to address such a slow traffic processing issue.As 6G standards and specifications are still under development, SK Telecom and Intel will seek to apply with 3GPP to register their new technology as a 6G specification after review, the Korean company said.3GPP is an international organization that develops technical specifications and technical reports for cellular telecommunications technologies.SK Telecom and Intel have been carrying out various research projects to develop critical wireless communication technologies for a decade.The latest development is part of their joint research to improve network traffic processing on an advanced AI-embedded core network and cloud.SK Telecom’s crosstown rivals KT Corp. and LG Uplus Corp. are also in a race to develop 6G network technologies. They are focused on the development of an open LAN ecosystem, the foundation of the 6G network.The Korean telco trio’s 6G efforts are expected to gain speed as the Korean government has also designated the 6G wireless network, considered the underlying technology for generative AI, as one of the key technologies the nation must obtain and take leadership, according to a plan unveiled by Korea’s Ministry of Science and ICT on Wednesday.Seung-Woo Lee at leeswoo@hankyung.com Sookyung Seo edited this article.",https://www.kedglobal.com/tech%2C-media-telecom/newsView/ked202402010012,"Tests conducted by SK Telecom and Intel showed that the so-called inline

"SK, KT, LG penalized for colluding to cut rental fees","SK, KT, LG penalized for colluding to cut rental fees","Telecom firms fined W20 bil. for causing losses for apartment tenants

By Lee Min-hyung

Korea’s three dominant telecom firms — SK Telecom, KT and LG Uplus — have been fined 20 billion won ($15 million) for colluding to reduce costs for renting locations that house their equipment, which the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) said Thursday was an unfair act caused by their oligopolistic influence.

They were also ordered to rectify the inappropriate business practice of reducing rental costs, which went on for six years (2013 to 2019). The telecom firms established a joint response team amid the then-rising rental fees for sites where their equipment was installed after the fourth-generation (4G) telecom service was widely adopted nationwide, according to the FTC's investigation findings.

They focused on cutting the rent, particularly at apartment rooftops where they set up equipment such as telegraph repeaters. They paid relevant costs for the use of such spaces but colluded to fix the rental prices.

Given that representatives of apartment residents usually decide the rental price for their facilities, the unfair act by the telecom firms ended up causing financial losses to tenants across the nation, according to the watchdog.

This strategy helped the firms reduce the average annual rental fee per contract by 940,000 won in 2019 from five years earlier, at some locations that they internally designated as requiring joint actions due to relatively high rental prices. The designated sites come with an annual rental fee of more than 5 million won.

They also turned out to have set up internal guidelines for rental fees for each region, and took joint action when negotiating with landlords or apartment representatives. They also fixed an upper limit of 300,000 won for annual rent when installing additional equipment for 4G or fifth-generation (5G) networks.

Customers were made vulnerable by the collusive acts of the oligopolistic market players. The influence of the top three firms remains rather big, as they also run mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) affiliates that borrow the networks of their mother firms.

“Their latest collusion has caused direct losses to apartment tenants and landlords,” an official from the FTC said. “The collusive act is also seen as a hardcore cartel in that big firms made joint actions to abuse their massive influence for price proposals.”

The antitrust authority pledged to step up monitoring of major firms and boost fair competition, thereby alleviating the public's financial burden.",https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2024/07/129_367603.html,"Korea's three dominant telecom firms - SK Telecom, KT and LG Uplus - have

LAS VEGAS -- South Korea's largest telecom carrier SK Telecom is seeking to expand cooperation with big tech firms to fulfill its vision of becoming a ""global AI company,"" according to its AI assistant service chief on Wednesday.



""SK Telecom’s AI services are anticipated to achieve effective results based on various possibilities and capabilities both here and abroad. To accelerate our global business expansion, we’ve formed a global tech alliance and cooperated with big tech firms,"" Kim Yong-hun, vice president and head of the company’s AI assistant service called A., told reporters on the sidelines of the CES tech show.



In its big global push, SK Telecom has launched an alliance dubbed the “Global Telco AI Alliance” with major telecom carriers in Germany, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates. The alliance agreed to make joint efforts to develop new growth engines through new AI-powered business models.



Kim said that more concrete results of the partnership could be unveiled during the Mobile World Congress, an annual gathering of the mobile industry, in Barcelona, Spain, in 2025.



“AI assistant services like the A. could see demand in overseas markets. We are working on how to seek synergy between Korean and overseas services through a one-source, multi-use strategy,” he said



The A. service is an AI assistant app for iPhones that made its debut in September. Its key features include recording during phone calls and real-time translations. Largely due to the recording feature, first for iPhones here, the number of monthly active users exceeded 1.2 million as of December.



Kim hinted that an Android version of the service is also in the works, particularly the translation service, which will be coming out within the first quarter of the year.



“The exact launch schedule (of the Android version) could be adjusted. We are trying to advance the launch to enhance the connectivity of the service,” he added.



Samsung Electronics, the market leader in Android phones, is scheduled to unveil its first AI-powered Galaxy phones during the Galaxy Unpacked event in San Jose, California, this week. The phones' key features also include real-time translation.

-- SK Telecom Co. is considering adding a large language model (LLM) to its iPhone call-recording app for the first time in the industry, an executive said on Wednesday, as the leading South Korean mobile carrier aims to apply on-device artificial intelligence as software to the A. app, which will allow users to operate AI on mobile devices without a network connection.“An LLM with fewer parameters may be included in an app although the LLM will have to perform well even with a small size,” Kim Yong-hun, SK Telecom’s vice president leading the A. app business, told South Korean reporters on the sidelines of the Consumer Electric Show (CES) 2024, the world’s largest annual tech trade show in Las Vegas.The LLM parameters are the different features of the language model, such as the ability to generate different types of text, the ability to translate into different languages, and the ability to summarize text. The more parameters an LLM has, the more complex it can be and the more tasks it can perform.The consideration came as Samsung Electronics Co., the world’s largest smartphone maker by volume, is set to release the Galaxy series equipped with on-device AI, which has real-time call interpretation features without additional apps. “On-device LLMs are expected to form a tech trend,” Kim said. “It was difficult to install LLMs on hardware in the past, but now chips have improved greatly and LLMs have become much lighter.”“A specific device LLM may increase speeds while cutting costs just like edge computing, although we need to keep testing how well it performs,” he said.Edge computing is a distributed computing framework that allows devices of the Internet of Things (IoT) to quickly process and act on data at the edge of the network.To improve the performance, SK Telecom may consider using on-device LLMs only for works that do not require high technology and cloud-connected machines for jobs that need advanced technology in the long run as the performance of the language model running on gadgets is limited based on their size, Kim said.SK Telecom aims to release an AI telephone function with call recording and real-time interpretation features for Android smartphones in the first quarter, Kim said.The A., SK Telecom’s AI personal assistant app, is currently providing the services only for Apple's iPhone models.“We are trying to show the functions’ completion to the market much earlier than our initial plan, although its Android version is somewhat late,” Kim said.The company is also improving technology for the A.

SK Telecom expands regional metaverse plan with new partnerships,SK Telecom expands regional metaverse plan with new partnerships,"Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

South Korean telecommunications giant SK Telecom (NASDAQ: SKM) has signed a new partnership with leading technology firms to expand its metaverse offering to new markets in Southeast Asia.

SK Telecom sealed the collaboration through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with key players in the telecommunication industry, Web3, and blockchain, company officials said.

The MoU sees SK Telecom join forces with Malaysia’s Celcom Digi, Indonesia’s Agate, and Philippines-based Cosmic Technologies to introduce the South Korean firm’s metaverse platform, Ifland, to new users. Ifland was developed as a personalized 3D virtual space for users to share thoughts and socialize with other avatars.

While Ifland has achieved moderate success in South Korea, SK Telecom’s ambitions have seen it eye new regional frontiers. The company confirmed that it has been conducting localization tests for the Southeast Asian market since June, expressing confidence in snagging a larger market share.

Under the MoU, SK Telecom will create global services while its new partners will develop content for its local customers. The company says the new strategy will allow for improved tailor-made content for users as it sets its sights on even grander ambitions of a mainstream global rollout.

In the future, SK Telecom disclosed that it is working on rolling out new language services for Ifland—Indonesian, Malaysian, and Hindi—to bring it one step closer to its MoU objectives.

Currently, the platform supports English, Chinese, Korean, German, and Japanese languages, with several brands, including 7-Eleven, inching toward using Ifland as a virtual storefront.

Ifland is different from the South Korean-based mobile carrier’s first foray into Web3, as the company has considerable experience in the field. In 2020, SK Telecom rolled out a blockchain-powered 5G phone, received approval for a digital wallet, and launched a digital ID service for customers while striking a partnership with on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant as a partner.

South Korea’s metaverse push

South Korea has emerged as the leading metaverse hub in Southeast Asia, powered by several key factors. The combination of public-private partnerships to fund metaverse activity in South Korea and a tech-savvy population has been described as a victory in the country’s ambitions.

“South Korea stands as the most aggressive and determined government in pushing the development of the metaverse,” said tech journalist Nina Xiang. “Other Asian countries don’t have similar types of metaverse programs in both scale and scope as that of the South Korean government.”

South Korea has splurged over $200 million to fund local metaverse projects and support creators, eyeing an integration into tourism, finance, health, and other key sectors of the economy.

SK Telecom expands metaverse platform ‘ifland’ with latest SEA partnerships,SK Telecom expands metaverse platform ‘ifland’ with latest SEA partnerships,"Seoul, Korea – Korean telecommunications provider SK Telecom(SKT) has announced its collaboration with Malaysian telecommunications provider CelcomDigi Berhad, Indonesian game developer Agate, and Philippine IoT platform provider and consumer electronics company Cosmic Technologies, creating mutually beneficial business opportunities through publishing partnerships for SKT’s metaverse platform, ‘ifland’.

For this initiative, SKT recently signed MoUs with Agate and Cosmic Technologies, and will further expand its previous partnership with CelcomDigi to carry out activities to boost ifland through localised content and marketing, and primary customer support.

Through the collaboration, Ifland will be updated with four additional languages, Indonesian, Malay, Filipino and Spanish. The platform will also be equipped with curative services so that it can promote tailored content for users in different countries and SKT will provide the necessary services to improve service quality.



SKT expects the partnerships to bring mutual benefits. The partners will be able to gain experience in the metaverse service without making initial investments for service development, and SKT will be able to offer content tailored to each country or region and conduct effective localised marketing via its partners.

Going forward, the company will provide more administrator rights to its partners to vitalize the use of ifland in each different region, and in the long run, it will seek partners in the U.S., India and Europe to accelerate the global expansion of ifland.

Talking about these partnerships, Yang Maeng-seog, vice president and head of metaverse CO at SKT, said, “We partnered up with three representative IT companies in Southeast Asia and are now able to promote the platform through tailored marketing that will be provided through our partners.”

“Through these partnerships, we will continue to do our best to provide ifland users with content and services that understand their culture and society by partnering with more local companies,” he concluded.

SKT began expanding ifland to the global market by launching the service in 49 countries in November 2022. Since then, it has been making efforts to increase ifland’s global presence by discovering a wide range of attractive content and features for global users, such as virtual meetups with K-pop stars.",https://marketech-apac.com/sk-telecom-expands-metaverse-platform-ifland-with-latest-sea-partnerships/,"For this initiative, SKT recently signed MoUs with Agate and Cosmic

SK Telecom (SKT) has announced partnerships with three leading tech companies in Southeast Asia to boost the global expansion of its metaverse platform “ifland”.

SKT signed agreements with Malaysia’s largest mobile carrier CelcomDigi, Indonesian game publisher Agate, and Phillipines-based electronics brand Cosmic Technologies.

The partnerships will allow SKT to provide localised content and marketing for ifland in the three countries. In return, the partners gain valuable experience in the metaverse without initial platform development costs.

SKT expects the collaborations to accelerate ifland’s growth internationally. The partners can tailor content and marketing to their local cultures while SKT benefits from their market knowledge and customer bases.

Discussions began earlier this year, with tests underway since July. The partners have already hosted local events in ifland for their users.

To boost global support, SKT plans major platform upgrades—including adding new languages like Indonesian, Malay, Hindi, and Spanish. Features will also help recommend content to users based on locations and preferences.

SKT says granting more administrative rights to partners will boost engagement in their markets. The company also hopes to ink deals with companies in the US, India, and Europe for further international momentum.

“By signing agreements with three leading IT companies in Southeast Asia, we will be able to carry out customised marketing in these countries,” said SKT Vice President Yang Maeng-seog.

“We will continue to provide ifland users with content and services that understand their local cultures by partnering with more companies.”

Ifland first launched globally in November 2022 and is now available in 49 countries. Recent efforts to boost growth include virtual meetups in the metaverse with K-pop stars.

The newly announced partnerships signify SKT’s commitment to dominating the global metaverse race through strategic collaborations tailored to local markets. As adoption continues, SKT aims to position ifland as the metaverse platform of choice for users worldwide.

SK Telecom’s decadeslong support for T1 pays off,SK Telecom’s decadeslong support for T1 pays off,"Members of SK Telecom's T1 raise a trophy after winning the 2023 League of Legends World Championship in Gwanghwamun, central Seoul, Sunday (Yonhap)

SK Telecom’s decadeslong involvement in Korean esports has once again reaped dividends -- at least in glory -- as its T1 won the 2023 League of Legends World Championship title for a fourth time Sunday, defeating Weibo Gaming of China.

The top telecom carrier in terms of membership launched T1 in 2004 when the nation’s esports industry was still in its nascent stage, as part of efforts to better engage with younger generations.

As LoL, the multiplayer online battle arena game, started gaining global popularity around 2012, the company reorganized the team by recruiting Lee Sang-hyeok, a talented player better known as Faker, a pivotal step to the team’s first championship in 2013.

SK Telecom's continued sponsorship led to consecutive victories for T1 in 2015 and 2016, propelling it as one of the strongest teams in LoL history.

Additionally, it adopted a system known as “T1 Rookies,” consisting of prospective players, to expand the talent base of T1. The three team members – Choi Woo-je, Moon Hyeon-joon, and Lee Min-hyung – who were instrumental in Sunday’s victory had emerged from the T1 Rookies feeder program.

SK Telecom, which has also maintained the presidency of the Korea e-Sports Association since 2005, also sponsors Korea’s national esports team, spurring the whole industry’s growth.

It produced renowned Starcraft players who spearheaded the esports boom early on, including ""Terran Emperor"" Lim Yo-hwan, Choi Yeon-sung and Jung Myung-hun, among others.

At the Hangzhou Asian Games this year, Korea did not drop a single game in its LoL gold medal campaign, with half of the players from T1.

“Going forward, we will continue to promote Korea’s esports industry in various ways, such as through the adoption of virtual reality/augmented reality games,"" said SK Telecom communications chief Kim Hee-sup.

""Recognizing its full potential, we will spare no efforts in supporting Korea's esports.""

With the cloud, SK Telecom paves way for 6G

SK Telecom has made headways in a cloud-based technology essential to advancing 5G and 6G wireless networks, the leading Korean telecommunications provider said on Monday.The company said that it has made improvements in power consumption and processing capacity for Open RAN virtual base stations.Open RAN refers to Open Radio Access Network, a technology which can separate the hardware and software of mobile communications equipment and standardize interfaces such that parts from different manufacturers can work seamlessly.The technology is an important element in the advancement 5G networks and commercialization of 6G networks, but it needs critical improvements due to its excessive power usage and lack of processing capacity.SK Telecom says it has conducted field tests — alongside partners such as Samsung Electronics, Ericsson, which developed a processor with a built-in accelerator and Nokia, which developed an inline accelerator — that showed effective improvements in such realms. An inline accelerator co-processes a CPU's workload, helping to speed up its output and reduce its power consumption.The telecommunications carrier also worked with Intel to develop AI-powered technology that can effectively monitor server processors by predicting traffic patterns. This is said to reduce a chip's power consumption level by 20 percent compared to those of prior virtual base stations.“This is a meaningful achievement, as we made tangible improvements in power usage and processing capabilities, two critical factors in an Open RAN virtual base station,” said Ryu Tak-gi, SK Telecom’s head of infrastructure technology, in a statement on Monday. “The company believes that the virtual base station will become the baseline for advancement of 5G and 6G networks and will continue to make headways in research and development.”BY LEE JAE-LIM [lee.jaelim@joongang.co.kr]",https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2023-11-20/business/industry/SK-Telecom-paves-the-way-for-5G-and-6G-networks/1917157,"SK Telecom says it has made significant improvements in the power

"What’s up with… Microsoft & OpenAI, Optus, SK Telecom","What’s up with… Microsoft & OpenAI, Optus, SK Telecom","In today’s industry news roundup: Sam Altman had an interesting weekend; Kelly Bayer Rosmarin has stepped down as the CEO at Australian operator Optus following the recent network outage; SK Telecom has been testing Open RAN technology and updating on its 6G progress; and much more!

A weekend is a long time in AI… Late on Friday, Microsoft-backed OpenAI, the developer of generative AI sensation ChatGPT, sacked its CEO Sam Altman, stating that “he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities. The board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI.” At the same time, it relieved OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman of his duties as chairman and installed CTO Mira Murati as interim CEO. Then all hell broke loose, as OpenAI staff reacted very badly to the news of Altman’s ousting: Murati tried to persuade the board that it should reverse its decisions and re-hire Altman, who returned to OpenAI’s headquarters on Sunday for talks. Those discussions did not go well, however – Altman posted an image of himself on X (fka Twitter) with a temporary OpenAI building pass, noting “first and last time I ever wear one of these”. It seems that Murati’s efforts to have Altman reinstated didn’t sit well with the board and, as a result, her tenure as interim CEO didn’t even last the weekend. Emmett Shear, a Silicon Valley ‘name’ and the founder of gaming sector community and streaming platform Twitch Interactive, was quickly installed as the new temporary chief executive, a move he also shared via a post on X. But the biggest news was yet to come as behind the scenes, Satya Nadella, the CEO at Microsoft, had been busy. Microsoft is very invested in OpenAI – it stumped up $1bn in 2019 for an undisclosed stake and then, earlier this year, extended the “partnership” with an investment commitment believed to be valued at up to $10bn. Microsoft also uses OpenAI’s products extensively across its portfolio. So, Nadella, not wanting to see one of its most high-profile and important investments spiral out of control, while also not wanting to see Altman set up a rival operation, acted quickly following Friday evening’s turmoil. In the final minutes of Sunday evening, Nadella announced on X that Altman and Brockman, “together with colleagues, will be joining Microsoft to lead a new advanced AI research team”. “We look forward to moving quickly to provide them with the resources needed for their success,” she added. In the same post, Nadella noted that Microsoft remains “committed to our partnership with OpenAI” and that it has “confidence in our product roadmap, our ability to continue to innovate with everything we announced at Microsoft Ignite, and in continuing to support our customers and partners. We look forward to getting to know Emmett Shear and OAI’s new leadership team and working with them.” Microsoft appears in total control of this situation and OpenAI now looks vulnerable. Whatever it was that the OpenAI board didn’t like about Altman’s behaviour, the decision to ditch the AI high-flyer looks ill-judged and hasty as it has led to a brain drain from which it might not recover. Normally, the days leading up to Thanksgiving are relatively quiet in US tech circles – not this year!

Less than two weeks after Australian operator Optus suffered a catastrophic network outage that left 40% of the country’s population without mobile services, the telco’s CEO, Kelly Bayer Rosmarin, has quit. She had answered questions last week during an Australian Senate inquiry into the outage, during which it was revealed that the service interruption was caused by the simultaneous and automated shutdown of 90 Cisco routers triggered by a change in the international peering network of Optus parent company Singtel. The inquiry also found that Optus did not have a plan to deal with such a scenario and were not aware that such an incident might happen. Bayer Rosmarin was asked during the inquiry whether she intended to quit but sidestepped the question, though Singtel announced early on Monday that she had tendered her resignation, which had been accepted. Singtel Group CEO Yuen Kuan Moon stated: “Optus appointed Kelly at the beginning of the pandemic, and we acknowledge her leadership, commitment and hard work throughout what has been a challenging period and thank her for her dedication and service to Optus. Kelly has always led with integrity and had all stakeholders’ best interests at heart. We understand her decision and wish her the very best in her future endeavours.” Optus CFO Michael Venter has been appointed as interim CEO while a permanent replacement for Bayer Rosmarin is found. In addition, veteran telecom executive and former Optus Business managing director Peter Kaliaropoulos will join the operator on 22 November 2023 in the newly created position of chief operating officer, reporting to Ventner. Singtel’s Yuen added: “Optus is an integral part of our Group’s business. We view the events in recent weeks very seriously. We fully recognise the importance of Optus’ role in providing connectivity services to the community and the importance of network resiliency and security. That is a top priority in all markets [in which] our companies operate. I have every confidence our Optus team will exert all efforts to deliver for customers and regain their trust and confidence.”

SK Telecom (SKT) has developed and tested a next-generation Open RAN virtual base station which, it claimed, delivers enhanced processing capacity and improved power consumption. The South Korean operator has conducted interconnection tests with Samsung and Ericsson of an open, virtual base station equipped with a built-in accelerator, and another with Nokia that made use of an in-line accelerator. In a test with Intel, it used AI-based technology to reduce the power usage of virtual base stations, and demonstrated that central processing unit (CPU) power consumption can be reduced to the level of an existing virtual base station, saving more than 20%. SKT believes it can address the main difficulties of open LAN virtual base stations: “This is a meaningful research and development (R&D) achievement that improved both the power consumption and processing capacity, which are important in open LAN virtual base stations,” explained Ryu Tak-ki, who is in charge of SKT infrastructure technology, adding that the company plans to continue its R&D efforts in the field. Further details of SKT’s statement are available here in Korean.

Still with SK Telecom… It used the recent SK Tech Summit 2023 to share its 6G insights and provide an update on the R&D progress it is making with emerging technologies, such as reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). The 6G session also included presentations from Japanese telco giant NTT Docomo and Bell Canada. Takehiro Nakamura, NTT Docomo’s chief standardisation officer (CSO), highlighted promising 6G technologies and discussed how Docomo and SK Telecom have been collaborating since they struck a strategic partnership in November last year. Javan Erfanian, distinguished member of technical staff at Bell Canada and the lead author of the 6G whitepaper of the Next Generation Mobile Networks (NGMN) Alliance, presented the NGMN Alliance’s 6G-related activities and global collaborations, including the Alliance’s 6G whitepaper published early this year. The whitepaper is the result of the joint work of around 40 companies, including SK Telecom, Deutsche Telekom, NTT Docomo and Vodafone. SK Telecom noted that it has been emphasising the need for global collaboration across South Korea, Japan, Europe and the US to ensure a successful 6G era (China did not get a mention…).

And yet more from the SK Telecom ecosystem… Sapeon, a fabless chip developer backed by the South Korean telco, used the occasion of the SK Tech Summit to unveil a new AI chip that it hopes will be able to compete with the processors on offer from market leader Nvidia, reported The Korea Herald.

AI regulation in Europe is a step closer after the French, German and Italian governments reached a consensus on how applications of the technology should be regulated, Reuters has reported. Citing a joint paper, it suggested that the three countries support “mandatory self-regulation through codes of conduct"" for AI foundation models but are against so-called “un-tested norms”. The risks lie in the application of the AI systems rather than in the technology itself, according to Reuters. Developers of AI foundation models would be required to define model cards that provide information about a machine learning (ML) model, to understand its functioning, its capabilities and its limits, the media outlet revealed. At first, no sanctions will be imposed but they could be created further down the line if violations of the code of conduct come to light. The European Commission proposed an AI Act in June and is in discussions with the European Council on the final form of the law, with an agreement expected by the end of this year.

South African operator Vodacom and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) have joined forces to pilot an AI-powered solution that could safeguard marine mammals from becoming entangled in rope-grown mussel farms. The innovation uses cameras and hydrophones to alert mussel farmers to whales in the area, and to activate an incident response if any do become entangled in the ropes. The early warning system will also be used to gather scientific data by recording the movement of marine life – this is also expected to help prevent ships striking other large pods of marine animals, such as seals and dolphins. The work is being piloted on South Africa’s West Coast but it could be expanded to more areas in the future. Find out more.

Altice, the multinational telecom operator owned by billionaire Patrick Drahi, looks to be in panic mode. The operator is saddled with massive debt (about $60bn) and needs to sell assets in order to reduce the size of its debt pile: The company is seeking bids for its Portuguese unit and a stake in its French operations as it scrambles to do so, Bloomberg reported recently. But Drahi’s efforts are being hindered by a corruption scandal that emerged earlier this year involving the group’s co-founder, Armando Pereira, who was arrested and placed under house arrest in Portugal this summer on accusations that he diverted millions of euros to other accounts via Altice’s procurement programmes and processes. Now Altice has issued an announcement that looks to draw a line under the scandal by noting that Altice Portugal was a victim in the proceedings and pointing out that Altice has severed ties with all the companies implicated in that scandal, adding that those companies accounted for very little of Altice’s expenditure. In addition, the telco noted that an internal investigation, undertaken by law firms Ropes & Gray and DLA Piper France, found that “no material impact is expected on Altice International’s or Altice France’s financial statements” as a result of the whole episode. Altice concluded that it has been an innocent victim and that everything is now OK. Will that be enough to convince potential acquirers? Drahi still has a lot of work to do to get Altice back in shape.

“Even before the black swan event of the emergence of (Chat)GPT last year, SK Group has been accumulating its capabilities in AI and new technologies as we (feel sure) about the growth of (such) innovation,” Ryu said in his opening speech at this year’s SK Tech Summit at Coex in southern Seoul.

While introducing SK Telecom’s “AI pyramid strategy” introduced in September, which focuses on three key areas -- AI infrastructure, AI transformation and AI service -- to realize the “global AI firm,” Ryu lauded SK’s vision and confidence in AI-based future growth led by the telecom giant.

Ryu vowed to create greater synergies “separately and together” with the group’s affiliates and key global partners -- Anthropic, Amazon Web Services and Google -- as well as with the member companies of the SK Telecom-led K-AI Alliance to cultivate a comprehensive AI ecosystem.

Under the theme of “AI Everywhere for a Better Future,” this year’s tech conference took place on its largest-ever scale since the inaugural event in 2016. A total of 17 SK affiliates, including SK Telecom, prepared sessions for the two-day event. Over 60 percent of the exhibition booths and presentations were related to AI technology, and around 9,600 attendees preregistered to attend the event, Ryu explained.

During his 10-minute opening speech, the telecom giant’s chief used the word “AI” around 50 times, while mentioning “SK” about 20 times to highlight how sincere and important SK considers the technology.

Anticipating a rosy outlook for the AI industry, Ryu said SK is making the utmost effort to reorganize its growth strategy to be centered on AI as it looks to do more than simply respond to the rapidly changing industry environment. “The future is up to exploration, not prediction. … SK is becoming a frontier that proactively pioneers the future,” he said.

“SK will strive to actively solve various issues and difficulties society faces through ‘people-centered AI,” the CEO said. “At this year’s event, we hope you will be able to experience the present and future that SK is creating through AI.”

At the conference, four keynote speakers -- Chung Suk-geun, chief AI global officer of SK Telecom; Jared Kaplan, Anthropic CSO; Slavik Dimitrovich, head of specialist solutions architecture of AI/ML at AWS; and Warren Barkley, senior director of product management at Google -- shared their visions and business experiences using generative AI.",https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20231116000641,"While introducing SK Telecom's “AI pyramid strategy” introduced in

SK Telecom verifies AI server liquid immersion cooling tech,SK Telecom verifies AI server liquid immersion cooling tech,"South Korea's SK Telecom Co. announced on Tuesday that it has successfully verified the liquid immersion cooling technology, a next-generation Internet data center heat management method.Liquid immersion cooling involves placing servers in a special cooling fluid that does not conduct electricity to manage heat.The company explained that this technique eliminates the need for server fans, reduces power consumption, and allows for stable maintenance of the overall system temperature without concerns about humidity, dust, and noise.SK Telecom built a system at its Incheon headquarters in collaboration with Texas-based Green Revolution Cooling, SK Enmove, and servers from various manufacturers. The equipment was tested and operated for four months starting in June this year.Through this, the company saw a reduction in cooling power by 93% compared to conventional air cooling, saving over 10% of server power and achieving a 37% reduction in overall power consumption.SK Telecom plans to establish a dedicated data center for its artificial intelligence (AI) services at its Incheon headquarters in November this year and aims to fully implement the immersion cooling system at the Incheon headquarters next year.Additionally, it plans to actively enter the immersion cooling business by combining data center monitoring solutions with SK Enmove's heat management business.According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the estimated global power consumption of data centers last year was between 240-340 TWh, accounting for 42-60% of the annual power consumption in South Korea.

Initiatives","South Korea’s leading telecommunications company, SK Telecom (SKT), has announced robust financial results for the third quarter of 2023, showcasing 1.4 percent increase in revenue to KRW 4.403 trillion. The company’s operating income increased by 7 percent to reach KRW 498.0 billion, with a net income of KRW 308.2 billion.

SK Telecom’s success in business can be attributed to sustained growth in key business areas, particularly in the telecommunications market, and the enterprise sector which continued to drive overall expansion.

A notable highlight is the rapid growth of SKT’s data center and cloud business revenues, which surged by 32.5 percent and 38.7 percent year-on-year, respectively.

SK Telecom’s Capex touched KRW 448 billion in Q3 2023 as compared with KRW 458 billion in Q3 2022.

As of the end of September 2023, SKT had a total of 15.15 million 5G subscribers, and SK Broadband secured a total of 9.52 million pay TV subscribers and 6.87 million broadband subscribers. Going forward, SKT will further solidify its competitiveness by using AI to conduct marketing, build networks and enhance network operational efficiency.

AI Pyramid Strategy Unveiled, Setting the Stage for Global AI Dominance

In September 2023, SK Telecom unveiled its ambitious vision to become a global AI company, introducing the AI Pyramid Strategy. This strategy aims to strengthen SKT’s competitiveness and foster global partnerships, focusing on three key areas: AI Infrastructure, AI Transformation (AIX), and AI Service.

Under the AI Infrastructure segment, SKT is set to enhance capabilities in AI data centers, AI semiconductors, and multi-large language models (LLMs). The data center business saw impressive growth, with a 32.5 percent increase in revenue, driven by higher utilization rates and increased demand for cloud services.

SAPEON, SKT’s AI semiconductor subsidiary, is gearing up to release its next-generation inference AI chip, ‘X330,’ boasting twice the computing power of the latest market models and 1.3 times more power efficiency. The company plans to continue advancing its AI technology brand, ‘A.X,’ with the establishment of Global AI Platform Corporation in the U.S.

In the AIX segment, SK Telecom is leveraging AI to innovate its fixed and mobile telecommunications business, capitalizing on its solid customer base. With 15.15 million 5G subscribers and continued growth in cloud business revenue (38.7 percent increase), SKT is strategically using AI to enhance marketing, network building, and operational efficiency.

Expanding AI Innovations in Mobility and Healthcare

SK Telecom is making significant strides in AI-powered innovations, expanding into mobility and healthcare. The company has collaborated with Joby Aviation to participate in the K-UAM Grand Challenge, aiming for the first commercialization of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) service in Korea by 2025.

Furthermore, SKT’s AI-based veterinary X-ray analysis solution, ‘X Caliber,’ launched a year ago, is gaining traction with around 300 veterinary clinics nationwide. Through a partnership with Anicom Holdings, the largest provider of pet insurance in Japan, SK Telecom is poised to take ‘X Caliber’ global.

AI Service Evolution and Metaverse Expansion

In the AI Service segment, SKT’s ‘A.’ personal AI assistant service, launched in September, is evolving rapidly with features like call recording, call summary, and sleep management, receiving positive customer feedback. The company plans to add real-time call interpretation services to ‘A.’ and expand its presence in the AI service market by entering overseas markets through collaboration with the Global Telco AI Alliance.

SKT’s metaverse service, ‘ifland,’ has garnered nearly 50 percent of monthly active users (MAU) from overseas, and strategic partnerships with global players like Deutsche Telekom and T-Mobile US are underway. The recent economic system introduced in October 2023 aims to expand the metaverse platform, creating a virtuous ecosystem and driving monetization.

Kim Jin-won, CFO of SKT, emphasized, “With our AI Pyramid Strategy, we will strive to ensure that SKT’s growth as a global AI company leads to the maximization of corporate and shareholder value.” The company’s commitment to AI and capital expenditure initiatives positions SK Telecom for continued success in the rapidly evolving technology landscape.",https://www.telecomlead.com/5g/sk-telecom-reports-strong-third-quarter-earnings-focusing-on-ai-and-capex-initiatives-113390,"SK Telecom, the leading mobile operator, said its Capex touched KRW 448

"SK Telecom's Q3 profit jumps 25.5% on robust growth of mobile, enterprise 
businesses","SK Telecom's Q3 profit jumps 25.5% on robust growth of mobile, enterprise 
businesses","SK Telecom, Korea's top mobile carrier, said Wednesday its third-quarter net profit jumped 25.5 percent from a year earlier, driven by robust growth of its mobile and enterprise businesses.

Net profit amounted to 308.2 billion won ($236.3 million) on a consolidated basis in the July-September period, compared with 245.6 billion won from the same period last year, SK Telecom said in a regulatory filing.

Operating profit rose 7 percent on-year to 498 billion won, and sales rose 1.4 percent to 4.4 trillion won.

The earnings exceeded market expectations. The average estimate of net profit by analysts stood at 291.2 billion won, according to a survey by Yonhap Infomax, the financial data firm of Yonhap News Agency.

The company attributed strong earnings to growth of its mobile communication and enterprise businesses.

Sales from SKT's mainstay telecom business gained 0.8 percent on-year to 3.1 trillion won as the number of fifth-generation network service subscribers continued to increase.

The number of 5G subscriptions reached 15.1 million in the third quarter, compared with 12.5 million in the same quarter last year.

SKT's enterprise unit saw its sales climb 5.8 percent on-year to 401 billion won in the third quarter, driven by strong demand for its data center and cloud business.

Sales from data centers jumped 32.5 percent on-year to 53.4 billion won on the increased operation rate of a new data center, and sales from cloud also soared 38.7 percent to 36.2 billion won largely thanks to recurring sales from its managed service provider business.

SKT's subsidiary SK Broadband Co. also saw its sales advance 2.4 percent to 1.04 trillion won thanks to strong demand for IPTV service.

The number of SKB's IPTV subscribers stood at 9.5 million as of end-September, up from 9.3 million a year ago.

SKT said it will continue to develop its artificial intelligence business, noting its AI chip arm, Sapeon, will launch a next-generation AI inference chip X330 later this year, and its Global AI Platform Corp. in the U.S. will release a platform tailored to large language models for telecommunication companies next year.

Metaverse platform ifland has also racked up half of its 4.2 million monthly active users from overseas, the company added.

""With our AI pyramid strategy, we will work to become a global AI company and maximize shareholders' value,"" Kim Jin-won, SKT's chief financial officer, said.

In September, SKT unveiled its plan to triple its investment in AI and raise 25 trillion won of sales by 2028 by creating a comprehensive AI business model.

"What’s up with… Network APIs, SK Telecom, NTT","What’s up with… Network APIs, SK Telecom, NTT","In today’s industry news roundup: Sri Lanka is a proving ground for the network API developments underway under the auspices of the GSMA’s Open Gateway initiative; SK Telecom adds to its growing AI ecosystem with two further investments; NTT’s driverless vehicle strategy shifts up a gear; and much more!

With digital service provider (DSP) technology and strategy stars now aligning, the era of network API services, along with new business models for progressive telcos, is upon us, Juan Carlos Garcia Lopez, SVP of technology innovation and ecosystem at Telefónica, stated earlier this year during a DSP Leaders World Forum address. One of the industry developments enabling the potential in that new era is the GSMA’s Open Gateway initiative, which was launched earlier this year. That initiative now has more than 36 mobile operator groups, representing 214 mobile networks and 60% of mobile connections worldwide, and it’s making tangible progress in a relatively short time. One notable example is a development in Sri Lanka, where all four mobile network operators – Bharti Airtel Lanka, Dialog Axiata, Hutchison Telecommunications Lanka and SLT-Mobitel – have prioritised and launched three APIs – One Time Password (OTP) Validation, Device Location and Carrier Billing – that give “developers and enterprises a standard way to technically and commercially reach over 21 million Sri Lankans, regardless of their network operator.” For further details, see this announcement.

SK Telecom continues to invest in artificial intelligence companies as it morphs from a telco into an AI company. The South Korean operator has invested 5.4bn Korean won ($4.1m) into Allganize, a large language model (LLM) solution developer, and 4bn Korean won ($3.1m) into ImpriMed, which is developing an AI-based anticancer drug prognosis model for pet dogs. The operator noted in its press release (in Korean) that both Allganize and ImpriMed are now members of the K-AI Alliance, which was formed earlier this year and now has 16 members. SK Telecom has been partnering with, and investing in, a growing number of AI developers for the past couple of years but ramped up its efforts this year with the development and unveiling of its AI pyramid strategy – see New partnerships fuel SK Telecom’s AI aspirations.

Japanese telecoms giant NTT is reportedly planning to invest around ¥10bn ($68m) into May Mobility, a US-based start-up for autonomous vehicle technology. According to a report by local newspaper Nikkei, NTT is looking to support the company with its goal of developing driverless buses and taxis by 2025. The startup is also financially backed by automaker Toyota, which is to produce the autonomous vehicles. Nikkei also reported that through the investment, NTT will obtain exclusive rights to sell the self-driving system, developed by May Mobility, in Japan.

Global radio access network (RAN) equipment revenue is expected to exceed $40bn per year in 2030, according to new research from Dell’Oro Group. However, the market is set to advance at a slower compound annual growth rate (CAGR) than during the 4G era (when CAGR was 2%), and it is expected to increase at just 1% CAGR between 2020 and 2030. The research house reached this conclusion based on an assumption that RAN revenues have already peaked in 2021 and will shape a downward trend before picking up momentum in the outer part of the forecast period. According to the forecast, growth prospects in the RAN market remain challenging, and a potential upside will come from emerging opportunities, including fixed wireless access (FWA) and private wireless, as they are set to play “a crucial role” in compensating for tepid mobile broadband advancements. Dell’Oro Group further predicts that small cells will comprise around 15% of the total RAN market in 2030, and that macro RAN and cloud RAN deployments will play a key role at the start of the 6G wave.

The AI market has a new contender in the form of Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok, which he has launched via his new company xAI. Grok, according to xAI, is modelled on the notorious “Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy”, meaning it aspires to “answer almost anything and, far harder, even suggest what questions to ask”. The company also noted that the system is designed to offer responses “with a bit of wit and has a rebellious streak”. The new service will use “real-time knowledge of the world” via the X platform (previously known as Twitter). Still in a “very early beta” stage, Grok is initially available to a select number of users, but there are plans to integrate it into ‘X Premium+’ , one of the social media giant’s new subscription options, recently introduced by Musk.

Chip design giant Arm has made an unspecified “strategic investment” for a minority stake in low-cost computer platform developer Raspberry Pi as the companies “collaborate to deliver critical solutions for the internet of things (IoT) developer community,” the duo have announced. “As the demand for edge compute accelerates, with the proliferation of more demanding IoT and AI applications, Raspberry Pi’s solutions are putting the power of low-cost, high-performance computing into the hands of people and businesses all over the world,” noted Arm in this announcement. “This investment further cements a partnership that began in 2008, and which has seen the release of many popular Arm-based Raspberry Pi products for students, enthusiasts and commercial developers.” Raspberry Pi technology is used in many different applications – it is at the heart of the Open RAN 5G network-in-a-box developed by Vodafone, for example.

What role might neutral hosts play in 5G densification plans? Boldyn Networks (formerly BAI Communications) hopes it will be a substantial one, as building and running shared wireless communications infrastructure is its raison d’etre. The company is encouraged by the results of a recent survey it commissioned, which found that “92% of telecoms decision-makers across operators and the public and private sector in the US, UK and Ireland are likely to work with neutral hosts to remove the challenges associated with 5G densification”. The results, while of course very favourable to the very company that paid for the research, do make sense, as while the pace of 5G rollouts has been reasonably fast, the full potential value of 5G services, especially for low-latency applications that would suffer from having to fall back onto a 4G connection, will only really come into play once near-ubiquitous coverage is achieved, particularly in key locations, such as shopping centres and sports/leisure centres and stadiums, and it’s not going to be possible for every operator to invest in their own dedicated network infrastructure to achieve that dense coverage. In some ways, it’s surprising that 8% do not think it is likely they will use neutral host networks to achieve their coverage goals, particularly as there are many locations where it is either very tough to roll out wholly owned infrastructure or where that approach doesn’t make economic sense. “Our industry has made great progress in rolling out 5G networks globally and confidence in its performance by business customers has rocketed. But to create the truly interconnected communities of the future, it is essential that we close the gaps in 5G connectivity – indoors, outdoors, in urban, suburban, and rural environments,” noted Justin Berger, group chief strategy officer at Boldyn Networks. “That’s what network densification is all about… operators and public and private organisations face serious challenges in achieving ubiquitous connectivity. So how do these decision-makers go about this? Our report reveals that neutral hosts will play a crucial role in network densification strategies,” he added. For more on the results of the survey, see this press release. Of course, it’s also worth noting that Boldyn isn’t the only neutral host infrastructure player that will be aiming to help operators and public bodies, such as national governments and metropolitan authorities, achieve their coverage goals.

With so much focus on data and video traffic these days, it’s sometimes easy to forget that there are still a lot of voice calls running over telecom networks and that traffic needs to be managed in an increasingly efficient and cloud-oriented fashion. One of the companies enabling that is cloud communications platform specialist Alianza, which has just raised $61m in new growth equity and debt financing that will be used to expand its sales team and go towards the $200m the company has pledged to invest in R&D over the next five years. “Future market opportunities remain substantial for [Alianza] with more than 100 million voice lines in North America nearing end-of-life and primed for transition from legacy TDM and softswitch infrastructure to the cloud… the cloudification of core communications networks is foundational for service providers to offer innovative retail solutions, as well as a prerequisite to leverage the future benefits of generative AI,” noted the company in its funding announcement. Brent Kelly, principal analyst in Omdia’s digital workplace team, noted: “Service providers are seeking next-gen voice and unified communications solutions as their existing infrastructure reaches end of life, and they look to improve their positioning in an increasingly competitive market. In order for service providers to thrive, they must become more than broadband network operators. They must reduce their cost-of-service delivery while improving the end-user customers’ experience. They need to transform from telcos to techcos. Alianza is well positioned to help service providers as they navigate this transition.”

SK Telecom invests in US-based AI startups,SK Telecom invests in US-based AI startups,"SK Telecom invested a total of $7.2 billion in U.S. startups Allganize and Imprimed

Korean carrier SK Telecom has invested a total of KRW 9.4 billion ($7.2 billion) in artificial intelligence (AI) startups Allganize and Imprimed, local newspaper The Korea Economic Daily reported.

As part of these investments, the Korean carrier injected KRW 5.4 billion and KRW 4 billion in Allganize and Imprimed, respectively, according to the report.

Headquartered in Houston, Texas, Allganize provides more than 200 corporate clients with a large language model (LLM) via generative AI. Some of the firm’s customers are Japan’s Sumitomo Mitsui Finance, retail giant Aeon Co. and Dai-ichi Life Insurance Co.

The report noted that corporate clients can buy apps from Allganize’s online market. The apps, powered by LLMs, can quickly analyze documents related to fields like law, human resources and marketing and provide summarized information, the report added.

The report also highlighted that SK Telecom is planning to combine its AI cloud computing technologies with Allganize’s apps to advance the LLM and expand the online app business.

Meanwhile, California-headquartered Imprimed provides personalized predictions on survival and response to specific cancer treatments. The company analyzes traits of a patient’s cancer cells and drugs to help identify an optimal treatment for the patient.

Following this investment, SK Telecom and Imprimed will work together to develop an AI model to predict cancer patients’ responses by analyzing clinical traits and genetic information, the report added.

K-AI Alliance, a group of AI startups backed by SK Telecom, has currently 16 companies. The alliance operates three sectors – AI service, AI transformation (AIX) and AI infrastructure.

In September, SK Telecom had announced its ambition to become a global artificial intelligence company by strengthening its own AI competitiveness and cooperating with partners globally.

The carrier’s CEO Ryu Young-sang unveiled the telco’s new ‘AI Pyramid Strategy’ centered around three key areas including AI infrastructure, AI transformation (AIX) and AI service.

Under this new strategy, Ryu said that the carrier expects the proportion of AI-related investment to approximately triple from 12% over the past five years to 33% over the next five years.

The company noted that AI Infrastructure is an area where SK Telecom’s technological capabilities are concentrated. The area consists of AI data centers, AI semiconductors and multiple LLMs.

Going forward, the Korean operator also plans to leverage its AI service-related experience and knowhow accumulated in the Korean market to develop a personal AI assistant service that can attract global customers. The company expects that its partnerships with diverse global players — including the Global Telco AI Alliance — will help accelerate its progress in the AI field.",https://www.rcrwireless.com/20231106/5g/sk-telecom-invests-us-based-ai-startups,"SK Telecom aims to combine its AI cloud computing technologies with

Deutsche Telekom and SK Telecom target telco CX with large language model,Deutsche Telekom and SK Telecom target telco CX with large language model,"Jonathan Abrahamson, Chief Product & Digital Officer at Deutsche Telekom, explains to Inform why the company is collaborating with long-standing partner SK Telecom to develop a telco-specific large language model (LLM) for digital assistants in customer service. And why there could be potential to sell it to other telcos.

The companies' LLM partnership is the first initiative of the ""Global Telco AI Alliance"", which Deutsche Telekom, e&, Singtel and SK Telecom announced in July.

An LLM underpins generative AI (GenAI) applications. Like many large communications service providers (CSPs), Deutsche Telekom has been working on artificial intelligence (AI) for several years. But the eruption of GenAI applications marks a sea change.

“It's difficult to envisage a world where this doesn't change everything and certainly in the context of what we do as a telecommunications company,” says Abrahamson.

But despite the impressive capabilities of off-the-shelf LLMs such as OpenAI, there is a “not insignificant amount of plumbing and orchestration that you have to build around the models to make them work for our [telco] context and … use cases,” explains Abrahamson. “What became very clear for us is to get really good with this … and to use it at massive scale we need to tune the model to make it work for our use cases.”

For a start, an LLM needs to understand the specific needs of a telco’s customers, and adhere to its brand, its tone of voice, and business rules, explains Abrahamson.

Off-the-shelf LLMs “have a huge amount of parametric knowledge which they've been learning from the open internet, but they don't know telco data all that well,” explains Abrahamson, adding: “What we're doing is sending the models to summer school to learn telco.”

Once an LLM is able to operate within the parameters of one telco business, it should be able to work in any other.

“We all have the [same] concept of prepaid or postpaid or broadband or TV,"" says Abrahamson. ""This knowledge is in ChatGPT but … not to that level where it can give a perfect answer [in a telco context], and that's the sort of stuff we need to build in.""

The partners will use Anthropic (Claude 2) and Meta (LLaMa2) to co-develop a multilingual tool for use in different countries, with the aim of unveiling the first version of the telco-specific LLM in the first quarter of 2024: Telekom Deutschland’s Ask Magenta service bot, which has been used as a digital assistant since 2016, will be an initial beneficiary.

Divining customer intent

An LLM’s reasoning capabilities mean it’s very good at analyzing customer intent and searching a telco’s back-end systems for the answer, explains Abrahamson. This is one of the reasons why it's well cut-out to help with customer support.

“When a customer says 'my internet machine doesn't work' a human would know it’s the router,” says Abrahamson. Traditional chatbots, however, would not – unless somebody physically writes a branch in a decision tree that states an internet machine equals router.

Deutsche Telekom’s chatbot Ask Magenta, for example, is a legacy system based on a long decision tree, where somebody has manually programmed each branch to answer a specific question.

“For the thousands of questions that a customer might ask, there are hundreds of thousands of things that could happen, and each of those [would have to be] … manually written line by line. Large language model replaces that [decision tree] architecture, to understand the customer intent and to craft the answer,” says Abrahamson.

Deutsche Telekom is already using the LLM to augment Ask Magenta's capabilities: today, for example, the chatbot is 80% dependent on a decision tree, and 20% dependent on an LLM.

Even for a large telco, developing an industry-specific LLM is a huge undertaking, however, which is why Deutsche Telekom values its partnership with SK Telecom.

Yet it is also because building a telco-specific LLM is so resource heavy that Abrahamson sees a potential to sell it to CSPs that lack the in-house capacity to build their own - even if for now its priority is to provide the LLM to operators within its own group.

Indeed, the task is such that “if this was available from someone, then I probably wouldn't go to the effort and expense of doing it,” says Abrahamson. Nonetheless, he also sees “massive value coming [from] this … and we like the idea of owning this IP. It's so fundamental for us.”",https://inform.tmforum.org/features-and-opinion/deutsche-telekom-and-sk-telecom-target-telco-cx-with-large-language-model,"Jonathan Abrahamson, Chief Product & Digital Officer at Deutsche Telekom,

SK Telecom (SKT) and Deutsche Telekom will jointly develop an industry-specific language model (LLM). This is specially tailored to the requirements of digital assistants in customer service. It makes it easier for telecommunications companies to deploy generative AI models efficiently and quickly.

This marks the start of the ""Global Telco AI Alliance"" of Deutsche Telekom, e&, Singtel and SK Telecom, which was announced in the summer.

“AI shows impressive potential to significantly enhance human problem-solving capabilities. To maximize its use especially in customer service, we need to adapt existing large language models and train them with our unique data. This will elevate our generative AI tools,"" says Claudia Nemat, Member of the Board of Management for Technology and Innovation at Deutsche Telekom.

SKT and Deutsche Telekom plan to collaborate with AI companies such as Anthropic (Claude 2) and Meta (LLaMa2) to co-develop a multilingual – i.e, German, English, Korean, etc. - large language model (LLM) tailored to the needs of telcos. They plan to unveil the first version of the telco-specific LLM in the first quarter of 2024.

“Through our partnership with Deutsche Telekom, we have secured a strong opportunity and momentum to gain global AI leadership and drive new growth,” said Ryu Young-sang, CEO of SKT. “By combining the strengths and capabilities of the two companies in AI technology, platform and infrastructure, we expect to empower enterprises in many different industries to deliver new and higher value to their customers.”

The two telecommunications companies have now signed a corresponding agreement (LOI) in Seoul for the joint development.

Benefits of Telco-Specific LLMs

A telco-specific LLM provides a better understanding of customer inquiries about telecom services than general models. This makes it optimally tailored for use in customer service.

A digital assistant based on such an LLM is particularly good at understanding, summarizing and answering these specific concerns.

The aim is to support telecommunications companies, e.g. in Europe, Asia and the Middle East, in setting up their own digital assistants based on generative AI. The new model is designed to enable them to develop a digital assistant that fits their environment faster and more flexibly.

Ask Magenta offers excellent customer service

One of the interfaces that will be the first to benefit from this development is Telekom Deutschland's Ask Magenta service bot. Since 2016, this has served customers as a digital assistant and as a central gateway for service requests. He can help with over 380 different concerns – from moving, new offers, questions about bills or appliances and also in the event of malfunctions. Here, for example, it automatically measures the lines and, if necessary, restarts them.

Since autumn 2023, ""Ask Magenta Voice"" has been available on the mobile phone hotline. Customers are no longer asked to present their concerns in several levels in keywords, but can speak it freely in natural language, as was already the case in the chat.

Last year, Ask Magenta conducted over four million customer dialogues. This frees up our employees time to deal with more complex issues.

The chatbot solves more than a third of the concerns immediately. In other cases, and also at the customer's request, human advisors take over and continue the dialogue almost seamlessly.

According to the annual analysis by COMPUTER BILD and Statista, ""Ask Magenta"" is once again one of the best digital assistants in the telecommunications industry in 2023.

In the first significant step for the two major telco players since forming the Global Telco AI Alliance in July (alongside e& and Singtel), the duo have signed a letter of intent to jointly develop a multilingual LLM, which will support languages such as German, English and Korean, with a view to launching the first version in the first quarter of 2024.

They will co-develop the model in partnership with companies already established in the AI domain: Anthropic (which scored a $100m investment from SKT in August) and Meta (known in this area for its Llama 2 open-source LLM, distributed by Microsoft).

As the LLM is specifically tailored to the needs of telcos, it will have “a higher understanding of telecommunication service-related areas and customer’s intentions than general LLMs”, making it suitable for customer service roles, such as at AI contact centres, explained SKT in a statement.

Ultimately, the LLM is intended to help telcos worldwide, including in Europe, Asia and the Middle East, to develop GenAI services, such as “AI agents”, flexibly and according to their respective environment.

“This will enable telcos to save both time and cost for developing large platforms, and secure new business opportunities and growth engines through AI innovation that shifts the paradigm in the traditional telecommunications industry,” the company noted.

To enable this, SKT and DT plan to develop AI platform technologies that telcos can use to create GenAI services to reduce development time and cost. AI can also be used for network monitoring and on-site operations, which is expected to deliver further efficiencies and cost savings in the mid to long term.

“AI shows impressive potential to significantly enhance human problem-solving capabilities.

German and South Korean telecommunications giants Deutsche Telekom and SK Telecom have signed an agreement to jointly develop a telecom industry-specific large language model tailored for creating generative AI customer service applications. The two want to accelerate the creation and deployment of generative AI chatbots by telcos worldwide as a way of streamlining and enhancing the necessary problem-solving process.

Telecom LLM

SK Telecom and Deutsche Telekom see existing models as incomplete for their needs and believe they must be adapted with industry-specific data to maximize their impact on customer service. The result should provide a superior comprehension of telecom-related inquiries in customer service scenarios. By partnering with each other, both corporations hope to combine their strengths and produce a better quality LLM than they might come up with working alone.

“Through our partnership with Deutsche Telekom, we have secured a strong opportunity and momentum to gain global AI leadership and drive new growth,” SK Telecom CEO Ryu Young-sang explained in a statement. “By combining the strengths and capabilities of the two companies in AI technology, platform, and infrastructure, we expect to empower enterprises in many different industries to deliver new and higher value to their customers.”

That said, the telecom-specialized multilingual model will be co-developed with SK Telecom and Deutsche Telekom’s generative AI developer partners. That includes Meta and Anthropic, with whom SK Telecom recently announced a $100 million investment. That deal pointed to this same plan for a new multilingual LLM able to communicate in English, Korean, German, Japanese, Arabic, and Spanish. The final result might fine-tune Anthropic’s generative AI models for telecom customer service needs.

The first version of the jointly trained model tailored for telecom applications will be unveiled in the first quarter of next year. Deutsche Telekom’s Ask Magenta chatbot will be one of the first interfaces leveraging the joint model. Since 2016, Ask Magenta has fielded over 380 million customer service requests through chat. Enhancements this year added speech recognition so users can inquire naturally without keyword constraints. The AI assistant now handles over 4 million customer dialogues annually, freeing employees for complex issues. Ask Magenta already solves a third of inquiries outright, with human agents seamlessly taking over when needed, the company claims.

“AI shows impressive potential to significantly enhance human problem-solving capabilities,” Deutsche Telekom board member Claudia Nemat said. “To maximize its use especially in customer service, we need to adapt existing large language models and train them with our unique data. This will elevate our generative AI tools.”

The goal is to support telcos across the world, including Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, to develop generative AI services such as AI agents flexibly according to their respective environment.

This will enable telcos to save both time and cost for developing large platforms, and secure new business opportunities and growth engines through AI innovation that shifts the paradigm in the traditional telecommunications industry.

To this end, SKT and Deutsche Telekom plan to jointly develop AI platform technologies that telcos can use to create generative AI services to reduce both development time and cost.

For instance, when a telco tries to build an AI contact center based on generative AI, it itself will be able to build one that suits their environment more quickly and flexibly. In addition, AI can be applied to other areas such as network monitoring and on-site operations to increase efficiency, resulting in cost savings in the mid- to long-term.

Through this collaboration, the two companies will proactively respond to the recent surge in AI demand from telcos, while also promoting the expansion of the global AI ecosystem through the successful introduction of generative AI optimized for specific industries or domains.

"What’s up with… 5G SA roaming, BT and Nokia, SK Telecom","What’s up with… 5G SA roaming, BT and Nokia, SK Telecom","In today’s industry news roundup: T-Mobile US collaborates with Deutsche Telekom Global Carrier, Sunrise and AIS Thailand on 5G standalone roaming trial; BT, with help from Nokia and MediaTek, is the latest to check out the potential of 5G RedCap; SK Telecom is offering content creators a way to monetise their metaverse activities; and much more!

T-Mobile US and Deutsche Telekom Global Carrier, the international wholesale division of Deutsche Telekom, have completed a test of 5G standalone (SA) roaming in partnership with Swiss operator Sunrise and Thai telco AIS Thailand. In the test, the companies used two of Deutsche Telekom Global Carrier’s solutions, namely internet protocol exchange (IPX) and hosted security edge protection proxy (SEPP), to conduct “the world’s first” test of roaming on a 5G SA network. As a result, the partners managed to complete 5G SA roaming between the US and Switzerland, and between the US and Thailand. “5G SA roaming changes the very meaning of staying connected while abroad,” said Ulf Ewaldsson, president of technology at T-Mobile US. He added that 5G SA roaming “opens the door for even faster speeds and increased reliability, enables emerging technologies like network slicing and will ensure the experience our customers have at home on our network travels with them practically anywhere.” T-Mobile noted that the 5G SA roaming solution allows customers to travel internationally while continuing to benefit from the best 5G experience available with 5G SA. While the roaming capabilities in question are not commercially available yet, T-Mobile US and Deutsche Telekom Global Carrier are providing a trial programme for those interested to test 5G SA. Find out more.

5G reduced capability (RedCap), designed to support internet of things (IoT) applications and provide greater bandwidth than is possible with LTE-M, continues to gain momentum… UK telco giant BT has completed trials of the technology using RedCap devices, in partnership with Nokia and MediaTek. The testing was carried out at BT’s Adastral Park, the operator’s research and innovation centre in south-east England, and used a 5G standalone (SA) network by its mobile business, EE, as well as Nokia’s AirScale RAN portfolio and MediaTek’s RedCap testing platform. According to the UK incumbent, RedCap can expand the IoT ecosystem and speed up its deployments, as the technology brings 5G to devices that do not need the full capabilities of the network (such as wearables or health trackers). BT announced it is also assessing the technology to support novel 5G use cases for businesses and consumers. “This trial with Nokia demonstrates the potential of RedCap technology in unlocking a new wave of innovation within the 5G services ecosystem. This is especially the case as we move towards the arrival of 5G SA, bringing with it enhanced reliability, responsiveness, security and speed which – through 5G RedCap – promises to benefit a host of new IoT devices and use cases,” said Greg McCall, BT’s chief networks officer. Other telcos exploring the potential of RedCap include Verizon and AT&T in the US, Optus in Australia, SK Telecom in South Korea, and China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom.

SK Telecom (SKT) has boosted the appeal of its metaverse service, ifland, with a new way for content creators to monetise their online material. According to the South Korean telco, it has established “a profit structure” designed to open the economic system within the platform by introducing a virtual currency dubbed ‘stone’, which can be acquired through in-app purchases. The currency can be used to purchase items and to sponsor hosts of events within the service. With the move, ifland’s influencers will now be able to generate profit by receiving stones from users who sponsor them to hold events or by creating online items. SKT has also launched non-fungible token (NFT) items on the platform by linking ifland to its NFT marketplace, TopPort. The telco expects the adoption of its new system to give rise to “a virtuous cycle that promotes the works and activities of creators and influencers, and provides users with a wider variety of items and better experience”. Find out more.

As expected, Telecom Italia (TIM) has received a binding offer from KKR for its NetCo unit, which includes its national fibre access network infrastructure. The NetCo bid is valid until 8 November, but that deadline could be extended until 20 December, the telco noted in this short announcement. Telecom Italia did not provide any financial details, but various reports suggest KKR’s offer is worth around €23bn. The operator is looking to divest assets in order to reduce its crippling debt pile, which stood at just more than €26bn at the end of June this year. The NetCo fixed access network comprises 15.8 million connections, of which 8.2 million are fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) lines. KKR also submitted a non-binding offer for TIM’s stake in Sparkle, its international networks and services unit. The telco’s M&A team will now examine KKR’s offer and then submit it to the board. That’s the point at which KKR’s bid could hit its next stumbling block, as the board includes representatives from the operator’s largest single shareholder, French media giant Vivendi, which has long held the position that the NetCo unit should not be sold for anything less than about €30bn.

Qualcomm is cutting 1,258 jobs, about 2.5% of its total workforce, in California, with the roles set to be eliminated in mid-December, CNBC has reported, citing a document filed with the California Employment Development Department by the wireless chip developer. Qualcomm noted in its third-quarter earnings report – in the 10-Q document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission – it expected to take “restructuring actions to enable continued investments in key growth and diversification opportunities” before the end of the year, due to the “continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic and demand environment,” and that those actions would “consist largely of workforce reductions”. For the third quarter of this year, Qualcomm reported revenues of $8.45bn, down by 23% year on year, and earnings before taxes of $1.76bn, down 59%.

Liberty Global has completed its takeover of Belgian network operator Telenet and now owns 100% of the shares. It had announced earlier this year its intention to increase its stake from the 59% it owned previously and take full control of the mobile and broadband services provider, a move that had the support of the Telenet board. “We’re delighted to be taking full ownership of Telenet, a move that will benefit not only Telenet customers but also Liberty Global stakeholders and shareholders as we continue to simplify our business,” stated Liberty Global CEO Mike Fries in this announcement. “Liberty Global has been a committed, majority shareholder in Telenet since 2007 and we fully support management’s exciting growth plans for the business. Under full Liberty Global ownership, Telenet will now undoubtedly be on a stronger footing to further grow the business, modernise its network and cement its preeminent position in Belgium for the long term,” he added.

The number of mobile operators in Taiwan is set to shrink following the Fair Trade Commission’s approval of the merger between Taiwan Mobile and Taiwan Star Telecom (aka T-Star), according to The Taipei Times. The decision follows the approval earlier this year of the planned merger between Far EasTone and Asia Pacific Telecom: Once those two mergers are complete, the number of mobile operators in the island nation will drop from five to three.

ZainTECH, the digital solutions provider of Kuwaiti operator Zain, has agreed to take over Jordan-based Specialized Technical Services Company (STS), which provides digital transformation solutions to countries in the Middle East. According to the telco, this will help its digital services unit to expand its portfolio targeted at enterprises and government bodies. It described STS as a company known for its “advanced hybrid multi-cloud solutions, robust managed cloud services and comprehensive cybersecurity offerings”, in addition to a “state-of-the-art” security operations centre (STS SOC), infrastructure and system integration capabilities, as well as licensing solutions. “This deal comes 20 years after Zain’s first regional expansion into Jordan and is a testament to our commitment to driving the Kingdom’s and the region’s digital transformation journey,” commented Bader Al-Kharafi, vice chairman of Zain and group CEO.

SK Telecom deploys 400 Gbps 5G wired network,SK Telecom deploys 400 Gbps 5G wired network,"SK Telecom initially applied this technology to the backbone section of the Seongsu and Boramae neighborhoods in capital Seoul

Korean carrier SK Telecom announced the deployment of what it claims to be South Korea’s first 400 Gbps high-capacity wired network, used in its 5G mobile communication backbone, local newspaper The Korea Economic Daily reported.

The carrier noted the new 400 Gbps network boosts network management efficiency by reducing the number of wired networks connecting the backbone.

“A rising number of services require large-capacity communication data traffic like artificial intelligence (AI) and the cloud,” the company said. “We decided to adopt this wired network ahead of the expansion of communication networks stemming from the future advancement of 5G and commercialization of 6G.”

According to the report, SK Telecom initially applied this technology to the backbone section of the Seongsu and Boramae neighborhoods in capital Seoul. The carrier said it expected to expand and install the 400 Gbps wired network to backbones across the country after further testing and monitoring tasks.

The new network is also expected to reduce energy consumption and improve environmental and social governance (ESG) management, through lowering the need for equipment space and lessening CO2 emissions due to reduced line construction, the report added.

SK Telecom also highlighted it will also closely follow network performance management including that of lines and equipment amid growth in backbone capacity.

Additionally, the carrier indicated that it will check the wired network’s performance based on AI and promote advancement of surveillance automation functions.

SK Telecom recently announced its ambition to become a global artificial intelligence company by strengthening its own AI competitiveness and cooperating with partners globally.

The telco’s CEO Ryu Young-sang said the new ‘AI Pyramid Strategy’ would be centered around three key areas including AI Infrastructure, AI Transformation (AIX) and AI Service.

Under this new strategy, Ryu said that the carrier expects the proportion of AI-related investment to approximately triple from 12% over the past five years to 33% over the next five years.

The company noted that AI Infrastructure is an area where SKT’s technological capabilities are concentrated. The area consists of AI data centers, AI semiconductors and multi LLM.

In the mobile business, the company stated that AI holds the capability to significantly improve both profitability and customer experience, adding that AI can not only be used to acquire/retain customers and provide better customer support via AI Contact Centers, but also be applied to the network infrastructure to enhance the efficiency in network deployment and operation. The company expects that, in the mid-to long-term, AI will help reduce 20 to 30% of costs compared to the current level.

Going forward, SKT also plans to leverage its AI service-related experience and knowhow accumulated in the Korean market to develop a personal AI assistant service that can attract global customers.

In the area of AIX, SKT said it will innovate its existing core business areas like mobile, broadband and enterprise with AI, while at the same time expanding into new business areas such as mobility, AI healthcare, media and advertising technology.

In the mobile business, the company stated that AI holds the capability to significantly improve both profitability and customer experience, adding that AI can not only be used to acquire/retain customers and provide better customer support via AI Contact Centers, but also be applied to the network infrastructure to enhance the efficiency in network deployment and operation. The company expects that, in the mid-to long-term, AI will help reduce 20 to 30% of costs compared to the current level.

Furthermore, SKT said it will continue to pursue AI innovation and expand the overall AI ecosystem by growing its new business areas such as urban air mobility (UAM) and AI-based healthcare services.

SKT also announced the official launch of ‘A.,’ what it claims to be the world’s first Korean LLM service released in the beta version in 2022.

The company said that ‘A.’ will evolve into a personal AI assistant service by innovating customers’ communication experience and fully assisting their everyday lives via seamless connection to a wide variety of AI services, the Korean carrier said.

SKT plans to add an AI phone service, which will provide a variety of AI services and mobile experiences based on understanding and reasoning of call context.

SKT plans to almost double its data center capacity by 2030 to host more AI-based services and workloads that generate higher margins. It will address the issue of energy consumption by introducing immersion cooling systems and hydrogen fuel cells.

On the semiconductor side, SKT is set to launch the next-generation inference AI chip ""X330"" at the end of the year through its AI semiconductor arm, Sapeon. The X330 has approximately twice the computational performance and is being touted to have 1.3 times the power efficiency compared to what is available in the market today.

On the multi-LLM side, SKT will be building its own LLM technologies while it continues to collaborate on them with partners such as Anthropic, OpenAI and Konan Technology.

SKT has invested $100 million in Anthropic to develop LLM customized to telcos, while it invested KRW22.4 billion ($16.6 million) in Konan Technology to enter the enterprise market with LLMs built for corporate customers. With Open AI, SKT is co-hosting an AI hackathon in South Korea.

Transforming core businesses with AI

SKT's core business segments such as mobile, broadband and enterprises – which sit in the middle of the telco's AI pyramid strategy – are set to undergo a series of major changes. At the same time, the telco operator will be expanding into new business areas such as mobility, AI healthcare, media and advertising technology.

In the mobile business, AI will be used not only to acquire and retain customers but also to provide better customer support via AI Contact Centers (AICCs).

These AICCs will also be deployed at the network infrastructure level to enhance the efficiency in network deployment and operation.

""The company expects that, in the mid-to long-term, AI will help reduce 20% to 30% of costs compared to the current level,"" SKT said in a statement.

Plan 'A'

At the top of the AI pyramid is ""A,"" SKT's personal AI assistant service that was officially launched yesterday.

""A"" will power a range of offerings, including an AI phone service that will provide a call summary as well as schedule tasks in the user's calendar based on the content of the call. More features such as real-time interpretation during calls will also be added in the future.

""A"" will also provide a sleep management tool and a music service that can automatically create a user's playlist.

The Korea Herald reported that SKT also plans to roll out a personal AI assistant roaming service that can provide about 1.2 billion telecom users in 45 countries, based on its global alliance formed in July. The telco operator joined hands with Germany's Deutsche Telekom, the United Arab Emirates' e& and Singapore's Singtel to expand AI cooperation.

""Just as we subscribe to two to three over-the-top platforms these days, telecom users are expected to use two to three personal AI assistants within the next three years,"" the newspaper wrote, quoting SKT chief Ryu.

Korean telecoms firm SK Telecom (SKT) is aiming to pivot to being a full stack AI provider with an emphasis on power management.

The SKT ‘AI Pyramid Strategy’ to accelerate innovation is centred around three key areas: AI Infrastructure, AI Transformation (AIX) and AI Services. By 2028, the company will triple the proportion of its AI-related investments and become a global AI company with revenue of KRW 25 trillion (US$18.5bn)

The AI Infrastructure plan consists of data centre, AI semiconductor, and multiple large language models (LLM) will serve as a technology platform. This will introduce energy-saving technologies including immersion cooling system and hydrogen fuel cells, and expand into the AI hosting business that generates higher margins by bundling these energy-saving solutions with Sapeon’s neural processing unit (NPU) and SK Hynix’s high bandwidth memory (HBM).

This will see SKT building energy efficient data centres globally, almost doubling its data centre capacity by 2030.

Sapeon, an AI semiconductor company established by SKT, will launch its X330 next-generation inference AI chip at the end of this year. The X330 has approximately twice the computational performance and 1.3 times the power efficiency compared to the latest inference chips on the market.

The power consumption of LLMs such as GEPT4.0 and Lama2 is also a key factor. SKT has invested $100m in US AI developer Anthropic to fine tune its own telco LLM called A.X LLM.

It has a two-track approach to secure diverse LLMs as well as an overall platform that encompasses the LLMs. It is advancing its own LLM based on high-quality telecoms data accumulated over decades while collaborating with a diverse range of partners, including Anthropic, OpenAI, and Konan Technology, to develop tailored LLM and related technologies specifically for the telcoms industry.

In addition, the company will continue to secure more sophisticated LLM technologies based on its supercomputer Titan, which ranked no. 47 on the Top 500 list of the world’s most powerful supercomputers; high understanding of the Korean language trained with the world’s largest Korean language data; intelligence platform where multi LLMs and AI technologies customized for diverse telco use cases can be used; and multimodal LLM technologies that support communication via not only text but also voice and video.

In the area of AI Service, SKT announces the official launch of ‘A.’ and plans to build a globally competitive personal AI assistant service powered by its telco and AI assets.

SKT will also evolve SK Broadband’s Btv service into AI TV to deliver a new level of convenience and value. For instance, ‘AI Curation’ will identify the user and show personalized TV; and ‘AI Home’ will allow users to enjoy various media services by conversing with an AI agent.

In addition, by combining multi LLM with existing AI solutions like Vision AI, Language AI and Big Data AI, the company to expand its data platform business to manufacturers.

It also plans to grow its new business areas such as urban air mobility (UAM), or air taxi management. It is a major investor in Joby Aviation which is building a production plant in the US.

“Destructive innovation triggered by generative AI is already creating new value in all areas of industry, society, and life. With our AI Pyramid Strategy, we will make accelerated moves to strengthen our own capabilities and cooperate with diverse partners, and expand our AI-related resource investments. Through these efforts, we aim to become a global AI company that benefits customers, increases industry productivity, and solves social problems with innovative technologies and services,” said Ryu Young-sang, CEO of SKT.

Earlier this year SKT teamed with SK Telecom, Deutsche Telekom, e& and Singtel to set up the Global Telco AI Alliance to create telecoms-focussed AI.

SK Telecom, Korea's largest mobile carrier, will triple its investment in artificial intelligence, pivoting away from its mainstay telecommunications business toward the hyped technology.Exact numbers were not given, but SK Telecom will increase the proportion of investment in AI to take up 33 percent of the total over the next five-year period. From 2019 to 2023, the figure was 12 percent.The company's target annual revenue was set to reach 25 trillion won ($18.5 billion) by 2028.SK Telecom CEO Ryu Young-sang says the company’s competitive edge in the AI realm is three-pronged: its Korean large language model A dot, urban air mobility (UAM) and AI health care.Ryu gave a particular emphasis to A dot, with a goal to turn the large-scale model into a personal AI assistant that leading global tech companies will scurry to strengthen their market presence in the sector.“I anticipate that within three years, a person will be using two to three AI assistants, similar to the phenomenon of a person subscribing to more than one streaming service,” Ryu said at a press event to introduce SK Telecom’s AI business strategy at its headquarters in Jung District, central Seoul, on Tuesday.“The question will be whether a user will use an AI assistant developed by Google, Naver or SK Telecom. And this company will become a market leader in this sector.”After rolling out a beta service in May 2022, A dot was officially released on Tuesday.A dot’s service lineup will gradually expand to include some interesting features. The company confirmed prior local media reports that call recording and call summary functions will soon be available on iPhone as well, but the exact timeline was not given.Both features are currently serviced to Android users.Other call-related functions, such as offering real-time translation services in Korean, English, Japanese and Chinese will be available by the latter half of this year. The number of languages will expand to 11 by the first half of 2024.Other features such as AI Music, AI Sleep and AI Mobility will tailor to the user’s daily lifestyle patterns and offer customized suggestions or functions.In health care, the company is focusing on developing its “X Caliber” medical AI service for animals, which is currently being utilized by some 300 veterinary clinics in Seoul. X Caliber analyzes animal X-rays and is able to detect seven musculoskeletal disorders and 10 cardiothoracic symptoms.“Soon, the number of vet clinics using X Caliber will reach 1,000,” Ryu said. “We are in discussion with other global companies to release the service overseas.”In the UAM sector, the company announced a goal to commercialize flying, carbon-free vehicles in Seoul by 2025 through a partnership with U.S. UAM company Joby Aviation. SK Telecom acquired a 2 percent stake in the transportation company through a $100 million investment in June.BY LEE JAE-LIM [lee.jaelim@joongang.co.kr]",https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2023-09-26/business/industry/SK-Telecom-to-triple-investment-in-AI/1878803,"SK Telecom plans to triple its investment in artificial intelligence (AI)

SK Telecom to triple investment in AI,SK Telecom to triple investment in AI,"The CEO of SK Telecom, South Korea's largest wireless carrier by subscription, unveiled on Tuesday the company's roadmap to leap forward as a global artificial intelligence firm within the next five years by expanding its business and technology based on its AI assistant service, A.

At a press conference held in Seoul earlier in the day, the telecom giant's chief Ryu Young-sang introduced the firm's new ""AI pyramid strategy,"" which focuses on three major areas: AI infrastructure, AI transformation and AI service. It is the key to realizing the firm's goal as the ""global AI firm"" by creating new industrial innovations, he said.

""The AI ​​gold rush has begun. SK Telecom is trying to run most aggressively into the AI revolution. Since telecom operators have no legacy, the AI revolution is a definite opportunity for us,"" the CEO said. ""We'll create business models that a telecom operator can do to be competitive in the market.""

For this, the telecom company plans to triple its investment in AI-related business from 12 percent from 2019 to 2023 to 33 percent over the next five years until 2028 to achieve sales of more than 25 trillion won ($18.5 billion) in 2028, while it logged some 17 trillion won in sales last year.

""Disruptive innovation triggered by generative AI has already created new values in all areas of industry, our society and life. ... SK Telecom will accelerate our execution ability and continue to expand investment in AI-related resources based on the strategy centered around self-reliance and cooperation,"" Ryu said.

As the AI ​​market is in full swing, data center supply shortages, excessive power use and rapid increases in carbon emissions have emerged as new social problems. SK Telecom will introduce energy-saving solutions to solve the issues, while making a foray into the global market. It is also planning to double the size of its domestic data centers by 2030, Ryu said.

Sapeon Korea, a global AI semiconductor company that spun out from the telecom giant last year, will launch the next-generation inference AI chip, X330, by the end of this year. It has the advantages of approximately twice the computational performance and 1.3 times the power efficiency compared to its competitors.

To secure competitiveness in the multi-LLM sector, it will strengthen cooperation with major Big Tech firms such as OpenAI.

SK Telecom looks to expand AI services to its existing telecommunications and IPTV services to reduce their costs by more than 20-30 percent in the mid to long term, as well as to non-telecom sectors, including Urban Air Mobility, health care and media.

At Tuesday's event, the CEO announced the official launch of A., which began its beta service in May last year. Based on A., the company will provide an AI phone service with call summary and calendar functions, AI sleep management tool and AI music service that can create users' playlists.

Additionally, SK Telecom plans to roll out a personal AI assistant roaming service that can provide about 1.2 billion telecom users in 45 countries, based on its global alliance formed in July. The Korean telecom firm joined hands with Germany's Deutsche Telekom, the United Arab Emirates's e& and Singapore's Singtel to expand AI cooperation.

""Just as we subscribe to two to three over-the-top platforms these days, telecom users are expected to use two to three personal AI assistants within the next three years,"" the SK Telecom chief said. ""The personal AI assistant market will likely become a battleground for leading global firms in the near future.""",https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20230926000646,"The CEO of SK Telecom, South Korea's largest wireless carrier by

SK Telecom to beef up AI investment threefold,SK Telecom to beef up AI investment threefold,"SK Telecom (SKT) unveiled an AI pyramid strategy focusing on infrastructure, transformation and services, with the aim of tripling investments in projects related to the technology by 2028.

During a press conference today (26 September), CEO Ryu Young-sang (pictured) explained its goal is to strengthen its capabilities and collaborate with a range of partners to expand its footprint in the global AI market.

AI-related investment will increase from 12 per cent of revenue between 2019 and 2023 to 33 per cent over the next five years.

Ryu stated AI infrastructure covering data centres, chips and multiple large-language models (LLMs) is the base of its pyramid focus.

With high demand for data centres and rising greenhouse gas emissions, the company will introduce energy-saving immersion cooling systems and hydrogen fuel cells. It also will expand into the AI hosting business, which it explained generates higher margins.

Using its expertise in these areas, Ryu said it plans to expand its presence in the global data centre business by teaming with SK Broadband. It aims to double its domestic data centre capacity by 2030.

In the middle area of the pyramid covering its core businesses and new areas, it will use AI in marketing and customer contact centres, and to improve operational efficiency of infrastructure, targeting costs reductions of 20 per cent to 30 per cent.

SKT also officially launched the world’s first Korean LLM service A dot which it released in beta in 2022.

It plans to adapt A dot into a personal AI assistant service.

"What’s up with… SK Telecom, Telefónica & Ericsson, Nokia","What’s up with… SK Telecom, Telefónica & Ericsson, Nokia","In today’s industry news roundup: SK Telecom takes inspiration from the pharaohs as it outlines its AI strategy; Ericsson sticks a Telefónica-shaped feather in its Open RAN cap; Nokia wants to help network operators with their telco-as-a-platform strategies; and much more!

SK Telecom has been positioning itself as an AI company for quite some time but has now fully committed to that identity with the unveiling of its AI Pyramid Strategy, which outlines how it sees its existing telecom services and networks fitting in with its AI-focused developments. The pyramid has three layers: The AI Infrastructure layer comprises its datacentre, AI chip and multi-large language model (LLM) resources; the AI Transformation (AIX) layer comprises the evolution of SK Telecom’s main products and services, namely the mobile, broadband and enterprise application offerings, as well as specific business units related to targeted verticals, such as healthcare; and the AI Service, which comprises the company’s specific AI-native applications, such as the A. personal assistant platform that has been in development for some time already and has now been officially launched, having been in a beta version up to now. SKT aims to evolve into a “global AI company that leads the AI ecosystem by strengthening its own competitiveness” in multiple areas, such as AI assistants, AI chip development and AI datacentres, while working with multiple partners. The company’s CEO, Ryu Young-sang, noted: “Destructive innovation triggered by generative AI is already creating new value in all areas of industry, society, and life. With our AI Pyramid Strategy, we will make accelerated moves to strengthen our own capabilities and cooperate with diverse partners, and expand our AI-related resource investments. Through these efforts, we aim to become a global AI company that benefits customers, increases industry productivity, and solves social problems with innovative technologies and services.” And by 2028, SK Telecom believes it will have tripled its current level of AI investments and become a global company with annual revenues of 25tn Korean won ($18.5bn).

Yesterday we noted Ericsson’s commitment to Open RAN and suggested that it might ruffle some feathers in the competitive mobile infrastructure sector. Well, the Swedish giant has followed that up with news of an agreement that suggests the incumbent radio access network vendors are going to be tough to dislodge, even if Open RAN becomes the de facto way to construct a mobile network. The vendor has struck a deal that will see Telefónica, one of the telco community’s most vocal Open RAN supporters, develop its virtual RAN and Open RAN strategy using Ericsson’s Cloud RAN platform, including a non-real-time RIC platform (and associated rApps) for aspects of network management. Enrique Blanco, CTIO of Telefónica Global, noted: “We are excited to join forces with Ericsson. This collaboration brings together the best of both organisations, enabling us to leverage the latest advancements in virtualisation and cloud technologies. The network’s transition to software-based operations and the evolution to open and disaggregated network architectures will increase flexibility, enable new network architectures and models, and boost innovation.” There is no suggestion, of course, that this is in any way an exclusive relationship, but it does suggest that Ericsson is going to be tough to compete against, even when mobile network expansions and refreshes demand Open RAN-friendly systems.

Nokia has taken the next step towards becoming a major player in the upcoming telco-as-a-platform era with the launch of what it calls its Network as Code platform and developer portal. Essentially, the vendor can see that telcos, as part of their shift towards cloud-oriented platforms and operations, will increasingly make use of open APIs to expose their networks to third-party applications, as explained earlier this year by Juan Carlos Garcia Lopez, SVP of technology innovation and ecosystem at Telefónica (see The time is right for network API services, says Telefónica’s Garcia). The vendor has been building up to this point with a number of network-as-code presentations, as noted in this article from June, and now, following months of development in collaboration with telcos and application developers, it says it’s ready to offer up its platform and supporting software development kits (SDKs) from this December. In addition, it has struck a partnership deal with Dish Network, the US 5G network operator, to engage in an “ecosystem project that enables enterprises to develop applications using advanced mobile and 5G network capabilities.” Dish has long noted that it spies its greatest opportunity in the enterprise services sector and that its Open RAN-based network and cloud-native operations make it ideally suited to a telco-as-a-platform play. What’s important here, though, is that Nokia has developed its offering based on specifications developed by the Linux Foundation’s Camara project and the closely aligned GSMA Open Gateway initiative, both of which count Nokia as a contributor. Equally important is that proprietary hooks are not also part of the mix… We can expect to see similar launches in the next year or so, but Nokia looks to have hit the ground running with quite a comprehensive proposition.

Google has announced it is building a new transatlantic subsea cable system to connect Portugal, Bermuda and the US. Dubbed Nuvem, which in Portuguese translates to “cloud”, the project is set to enhance network resiliency across the Atlantic to meet the growing demand for digital services. Nuvem is expected to be ready for service in 2026, adding capacity, increased reliability and lower latency for Google users and Google Cloud customers globally. Alongside Google’s other subsea cable systems, Firmina and Equiano, the new cable path is expected to create “important new data corridors” connecting North America, South America, Europe and Africa. Nuvem is also tipped to be the first cable to connect Bermuda with Europe. According to Google, a subsea cable can bring a plethora of benefits to local communities, such as trade, investment and productivity gains. Find out more.

Three of the world’s largest operators are seemingly following in ABBA’s footsteps, by bringing the world of holography to life. As part of a joint effort, UK-based Vodafone, US telco Verizon and Bell Canada have conducted “the first live transatlantic collaborative meeting connecting multiple holographic people” in Canada, the US and the UK using 5G and multi-access edge computing (MEC) technology. They also partnered with Matsuko, a company that claims to have created “the world’s first holographic presence app”. During the meeting, holograms of real employees located in the different countries were connected using the three operators’ respective 5G networks in their home markets. They were created using Matsuko’s real-time software and a camera, and were then streamed with the help of spatial computing, a technology that combines virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR). Matsuko also connected to the telcos’ 5G networks using an application programmable interface (API) created by the 5G Future Forum (5GFF), called 5GFF’s Edge Discovery API, which allows developers and independent software vendors (ISVs) to discover “the nearest edge to their end users, so their applications perform optimally with a consistent service across mobile networks”. The demonstration was made by Vodafone, Verizon and Bell Canada under the auspices of the 5GFF.

Japanese telco NTT Docomo has agreed to transfer 1,552 towers to neutral host JTower, in addition to a previous transfer agreement covering 6,002 towers, for ¥17bn ($114m). As part of the deal, NTT Docomo will lease the towers from JTower, with its goal being to make gains from sharing its infrastructure. “The addition of this new agreement will enable the two companies to strengthen their network building, it will also enable the towers to be used for a wider range of applications, facilitating the further sharing of infrastructure,” the Japanese operator said in its statement unveiling the move. The companies aim to realise “more efficient capital investments and lower operating expenses for tower tenants,” the statement noted, adding that they also “plan to promote the early deployment of 5G networks”. The pair also pledged to contribute to the achievement of “a sustainable society, reducing the environmental impact of their infrastructure through its effective use.” Find out more.

NTT Ltd, the enterprise services-focused arm of the Japanese telco giant, has struck a “strategic engagement” with wireless chip giant Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. to “invest in and accelerate the development of the 5G device ecosystem to facilitate private 5G adoption, which is critical to powering AI at the edge.” According to NTT Ltd, the two companies will “prioritise the development of 5G-enabled devices to accelerate innovation with global enterprise customers, a critical catalyst in driving widespread enterprise adoption of private 5G, a market that IDC estimates will be worth in excess of $8bn by 2026. Qualcomm Technologies’ leadership in application specific semiconductors and 5G chipsets, combined with NTT’s leadership in private 5G, will strengthen the 5G ecosystem, advance AI processing capabilities at the edge and spur innovation across industries.”

SK Telecom unveils ‘AI pyramid’ strategy and plans to triple AI investment,SK Telecom unveils ‘AI pyramid’ strategy and plans to triple AI investment,"James has a passion for how technologies influence business and has several Mobile World Congress events under his belt. James has interviewed a variety of leading figures in his career, from former Mafia boss Michael Franzese, to Steve Wozniak, and Jean Michel Jarre. James can be found tweeting at @James_T_Bourne.

SK Telecom (SKT) has set a date of 2028 to become a global AI leader, with plans to triple the proportion of its AI-related investments and a revenue target of KRW 25 trillion (£15.1bn).

The operator currently devotes approximately 12% of its investment towards AI and related disciplines, based on 2019 to 2023 figures. Between 2024 and 2028, this number is expected to rise to 33%.

SK Telecom’s AI pyramid has three layers. The bottom layer is AI infrastructure, which consists of artificial intelligence-flavoured data centres and semiconductors, as well as multiple large language models (LLMs). Tangible investment in this area will include solutions such as immersion cooling systems and hydrogen fuel cells for the data centre side.

Much of the innovation will come from Sapeon, an AI semiconductor company established by SKT. The company, in its own words, was ‘born to meet needs for cloud AI inference’, and is set to launch X330, a chip which promises twice the computational performance of other AI inference chips on the market. X330 also promises 1.3 times the power efficiency of competitors, again looking at the sustainability angle.

In terms of wider AI credentials, SKT has a strong supporting cast for its multi-LLM strategy. Partners include Anthropic – who it was reported earlier this week got a multi-billion dollar investment from Amazon – and OpenAI. SK Telecom itself pumped $100 million USD into Anthropic last month.

The two-track approach ‘secures a diverse LLM lineup as well as an overall platform that encompasses the LLMs’, as the company put it. This will heavily utilise both telco-specific large language models, as well as an intelligence platform where multi-LLMs and AI technologies ‘customised for diverse telco use cases’ can be utilised. SKT has also named its AI technology ‘A.X’ and its LLM ‘A.X LLM.’

The two remaining layers of the pyramid are more business-focused. AI transformation (AIX), the middle layer, will see SK Telecom innovate existing core business areas with AI, including mobile, broadband, and enterprise. AI contact centres will reduce up to 30% of the company’s costs in the medium- to long-term level, according to a company estimate.

For the top layer, AI service, SKT announced the official launch of ‘A.’ – if you are keeping up with all these monikers – which will in time become a personal AI assistant. While the claim that a forthcoming AI phone service ‘enables new connections through communication innovation that can only be achieved by a telco’ might raise an eyebrow, the use cases sound interesting, including recommending people to call based on call history. Other potential services the company will explore include music and sleep management.

“Destructive innovation triggered by generative AI is already creating new value in all areas of industry, society, and life. With our AI pyramid strategy, we will make accelerated moves to strengthen our own capabilities and cooperate with diverse partners, and expand our AI-related resource investments,” said Ryu Young-sang, CEO of SK Telecom.

“Through these efforts, we aim to become a global AI company that benefits customer, increases industry productivity, and solves social problems with innovative technologies and services,” added Ryu.

By Baek Byung-yeul

SK Telecom will triple its investment in AI technology in next five years as part of the domestic telecommunications giant’s plan to provide enhanced services with AI competitiveness and generate sales of 25 trillion won ($18.5 billion) by 2028, its CEO said Tuesday.

“The hyperscale AI revolution, sparked by OpenAI’s ChatGPT service last November, has been met with some skepticism lately. However, the AI market is still in its infancy, and the way the industry is moving and the technology is evolving, I believe the gold rush for AI businesses has begun,” SK Telecom CEO Ryu Young-sang said during a press conference in Seoul.

By concentrating more on AI, the CEO said the telecommunications company will be able to get a better market valuation.

“SK Telecom has invested heavily in AI services, technology and infrastructure over the past five years. We have invested 12 percent of our capital in AI, and we plan to increase it to 33 percent over the next five years until 2028, and increase our sales to 25 trillion won by 2028 so that we can be better valued by the market,” the CEO said.

Sharing the company's AI business strategy, Ryu said it will employ what it calls an ""AI Pyramid"" strategy to transform its business around three areas: AI infrastructure, transformation to AI ― which he called AIX ― and AI services.

Through taking steps such as upgrading its own AI capability, creating AI services to provide enhanced services to customers and cooperating with AI partners, SK Telecom will be able to become a truly global AI company.

“The AI Pyramid strategy is to create new value through AI in our existing businesses in addition to enhancing our AI service, A. (pronounced as ‘A dot’). We established the AI Pyramid strategy not as a concept to abandon our existing businesses, but as a strategy to embrace them all,” the CEO said.

At the bottom of the pyramid, which is the AI infrastructure part, the company will promote the expansion of AI data centers, AI semiconductors and various large language models (LLMs). The CEO said that its AI chip affiliate Sapeon’s latest AI chip X330 will be released later this year, taking on rival Nvidia.

SK Telecom also unveiled its LLM, A.X, and said that in addition to its own LLM, the company will pursue a two-track strategy by cooperating with domestic and overseas AI players such as Anthropic, OpenAI and Konan Technology.

For AIX, at the middle of its AI Pyramid, the company will transform productivity and customer experience by embedding AI across core businesses and expand its AI capabilities into mobility, AI health care, media and advertising technology. For AI services, which is the top of the AI Pyramid strategy, the company will provide improved AI-powered personal assistant service with its A.

SK Broadband improves its cash position through Netflix agreement,SK Broadband improves its cash position through Netflix agreement,"South Korean ISP SK Broadband and video streaming giant Netflix have ended their dispute over network usage fees.

SK Broadband parent SK Telecom and Netflix announced the end of the legal battle Monday morning Korean time, revealing they had agreed on a ""strategic partnership to provide better entertainment experiences.""

The end of the years-long dispute comes as telcos in Europe and India are seeking similar fees from OTT players to compensate for costs incurred in deploying capacity to accommodate their traffic.

SKT and Netflix did not disclose financial terms. They said they would work together to offer easier access and payment options for Netflix content. SKT and SK Broadband will offer bundled products and various price plans, the statement said.

That could be as much as 40 billion Korean won (US$30.2 million), according to local executives. They believe SK Broadband had decided that that was more than it would receive through a lawsuit, the Seoul newspaper reported.

Even so, insiders were puzzled by its decision to settle, noting that Netflix had lost the original court case and was no doubt concerned at the financial impact of further court losses.

Fresh lawsuits

A Seoul court had ruled against it in mid-2021, determining that under the Telecommunications Business Act, the US streaming firm was liable to pay network traffic fees. It ordered the two parties to negotiate; instead, they launched fresh lawsuits against each other.

If it had won these court battles, SK Broadband would not only have won a financial settlement from Netflix but would also have been in a strong position to negotiate with YouTube, Korea's biggest source of internet traffic. (SK Broadband already receives fees from Facebook, Apple and Amazon – a point it has repeatedly made in its battle against Netflix.)

It had been in dispute with Netflix for some time over the massive escalation in streaming traffic over its network – from 50 Gbit/s in May 2018 to 1.277 Tbit/s in September 2021 – thanks mainly to the popularity of Korean TV content such as Squid Game.

Netflix had argued that its Open Connect content delivery platform, deployed with ISPs worldwide, had already reduced the volume of traffic by 95%. It said in an October 2021 statement that the overwhelming majority of ISPs used Open Connect – ""except for a single broadband player in Korea who is seeking to use its dominance to extract an arbitrary payment.""

Analysts point to two other factors that may have weighed on SK Broadband. One is that its media arm has struggled to compete with local rivals such as KT Corp. and LG Uplus in streaming services. An alliance with Netflix could help close the gap.

The other is that when it spun off from its parent three years ago, SK Broadband committed to an IPO by 2025. By striking the agreement with Netflix, it removes one of its operating costs and instantly improves its cash position, helping to smooth its path to a listing.

As part of the partnership, SK Telecom aims to enhance the convenience of accessing and paying for Netflix shows and movies on mobile devices and IPTV for their customers. They will provide a range of pricing options and product bundles for users; including services that incorporate Netflix’s ad-supported pricing model.

Tony Zameczkowski, VP of APAC Partnerships at Netflix, commented: “The partnership with SK Telecom, a leader in Korea’s telecommunication and innovative technology industries, holds special significance as it enables Netflix to enhance entertainment experiences for a broader Korean audience.

“Netflix is committed to creating and delivering the best stories to members in Korea and audiences worldwide, and we have high expectations for the journey ahead as partners serving our customers with SK Telecom and SK Broadband.”

The streaming giant is also exploring harnessing AI technologies developed by SK Telecom – including conversational UX and personalised recommendation technologies – to enhance the experience for Netflix’s customers.

Choi Hwan-seok, VP and Head of the Corporate Strategy Office at SK Telecom, stated: “This strategic partnership with Netflix originates from the philosophy of SK Telecom and SK Broadband, where customer value is prioritised and comes as part of our efforts to provide customers with an enhanced media service environment.”

Settling differences

The feud between SK Telecom and Netflix began in October 2021, when SK Telecom initiated legal action against Netflix. At the heart of the dispute was the question of who should foot the bill for the colossal amount of data transmitted over mobile networks due to Netflix’s hit shows.

In September 2021 alone, Netflix sent a staggering 1.2 terabits per second of content through SK Telecom’s network. SK Telecom contended that Netflix should shoulder the surging costs it incurred in managing this torrent of data and demanded $24 million in network usage fees for 2020, asserting that Netflix was responsible for a significant share of South Korea’s Q4 2020 network traffic.

On the other hand, Netflix argued that it should not be penalised for its success. The streaming giant pointed to its content delivery network, Open Connect, which is provided free of charge and reduces network traffic by at least 95 percent. Netflix claimed that SK Telecom had ignored this tool, putting the onus of network costs on Netflix.

While the resolution of the dispute through a strategic partnership marks a new chapter for SK Telecom and Netflix, the feud reignited the contentious debate over “net neutrality”.

Net neutrality is the principle that Internet service providers should treat all data on the Internet equally, without discriminating or charging differentially based on the content or source.

Critics argue that SK Telecom’s initial legal action against Netflix raised questions about net neutrality, as it seemed to suggest that SK Telecom wanted to charge Netflix extra for delivering its content—potentially giving preferential treatment to certain services over others.

Proponents of net neutrality assert that all internet traffic should be treated impartially, without favouring or discriminating against specific content providers.

Without net neutrality, startups have even more of an uphill battle against successful incumbents that can attract exclusive deals or afford preferential treatment—leading to a less competitive environment and downgraded service for consumers.

While the partnership between SK Telecom and Netflix may have ended their legal dispute, it has cast a spotlight on the broader issues surrounding net neutrality. As these industry giants join forces to shape the future of digital entertainment, the debate over how the internet should be governed and regulated is likely to continue.

"What’s up with… SK Telecom & Netflix, Singtel, satellite 5G","What’s up with… SK Telecom & Netflix, Singtel, satellite 5G","In today’s industry news roundup: SK Telecom and Netflix have buried their differences and are now collaborating on service delivery and R&D; Singtel is selling a 20% stake in its datacentre business to private equity firm KKR; 5G from space is going to be a money-spinner, reckons Juniper Research; and more!

SK Telecom (SKT) and Netflix have ended a legal dispute, which started in 2020, about whether the streaming giant should cover costs related to the rise in network traffic and required maintenance, as it is considered a significant contributor to surging traffic demand. In a reconciliatory move, the companies have announced a partnership that covers new entertainment content and will be provided by SKT and its subsidiary SK Broadband. As part of the tie-up, the South Korean operator will deliver various products, such as bundled packages, to its customers, with new offerings tabled for the first half of 2024. Another notable part of the deal involves exploring AI technologies, developed by SKT and SK Broadband, such as conversational user experience (conversational UX) and personalised recommendation technologies, to improve the operator’s entertainment play and to further boost its ambitions to be an “AI company”. “This strategic partnership with Netflix originates from the philosophy of SK Telecom and SK Broadband, where customer value is prioritised, and comes as part of our efforts to provide customers with an enhanced media service environment,” said Choi Hwan-seok, vice president and head of the corporate strategy office at SKT.

Singaporean operator Singtel has agreed to sell a 20% stake in its datacentre business to a fund managed by private equity firm KKR (Kohlberg Kravis Roberts) for up to S$1.1bn (US$806m). The move has brought the enterprise value of Singtel’s regional datacentre operation to S$5.5bn (US$4bn). Under the terms of the deal, KKR will be able to beef up its stake to 25% by 2027 at the pre-agreed valuation. In a statement, the operator explained that the proceeds from the sale will be used to speed up the expansion of the datacentre business across markets in southeast Asia, including Singapore, Indonesia and Thailand, adding that it envisions exploring other countries, such as Malaysia. The investment “will widen the business’ strategic choices, giving a variety of options to monetise in the future,” according to the company. Singtel has been quick to lure interest in its assets, as the KKR investment comes several months after the telco unveiled a structural overhaul, making its datacentre business part of the new Digital InfraCo unit. It has also been making efforts to grow its datacentre portfolio, with new facilities in Singapore, Indonesia and Thailand. “KKR’s investment underscores the quality of our datacentre portfolio and confidence in our plans to scale the business by capitalising on the digitalisation and rapid AI adoption that is transforming this region. Our expertise in designing, building and operating datacentres, and our connectivity leadership in the region, together with KKR’s strong track record in supporting digital infrastructure assets and its platform-building expertise, makes for a powerful combination,” commented Bill Chang, CEO of Singtel’s Digital InfraCo. The market for datacentre services across southeast Asia is projected to grow by 17% over the next five years, outpacing the estimated increase of 12% in the rest of the world in the period, while the region is also expected to bring between US$9bn and US$13bn in investments into the sector.

Telcos have been hedging their bets on satellite-based connectivity solutions and it seems that their creativity might in fact pay off. At least that’s what a new Juniper Research report suggests, as it estimates operators will generate $17bn in additional revenue from 5G-enabled satellite networks between 2024 and 2030. The research predicts that the first commercial launch of a 5G satellite network will be in 2024, and that more than 110 million 3GPP-compliant 5G satellite connections will be in operation by the end of the current decade. To reap the potential benefits, though, Juniper Research urged operators to prioritise “immediate partnerships” with satellite network operators (SNOs) that can launch geostationary orbit (GSO) satellites (which follow the Earth’s rotation in a way that they are always located above the country that the operator serves for consistent connectivity), and to launch “monetisable satellite-based 5G services”. Another recommendation for telcos is to leverage their pre-existing billing relationship with mobile subscribers and enterprises as a platform, as this is tipped to enable operators to “rapidly drive the adoption of satellite connectivity by integrating satellite services into existing terrestrial networks.” According to the research, operators will rely on SNOs even more with the acceleration of 6G developments. “Operators must not only think of 5G satellite services when choosing an SNO partner, but also the forward plan for 6G networks, including coverage and throughput capabilities,” noted research author Sam Barker.

Notable departures from prominent top-level roles keep turning the spotlight on Japanese telco group Rakuten. Only a month after Tareq Amin abruptly left as CEO of Rakuten Mobile and its vendor offshoot Rakuten Symphony, the latter has now lost its CEO in North America, Azita Arvani. The announcement came from Arvani herself, who shared in a LinkedIn post that she has made “the difficult decision to part ways with Rakuten” after four years at the helm of Rakuten Symphony’s North American unit. She highlighted that during her time in charge of the business, the team had “laid the foundation for our business, achieving remarkable milestones and cultivating invaluable relationships with esteemed customers, such as AT&T, Dish Networks, Telus and numerous others”. Describing the experience with Rakuten as “significant” and “transformative”, Arvani claimed she had dedicated herself “wholeheartedly to our shared vision, pouring not only my time and effort but also my blood, sweat and tears into our collective mission… Every moment of this challenge brought me profound satisfaction, and I feel truly blessed to have had the opportunity to collaborate with such visionary customers on innovative projects”. Without citing a concrete reason for her departure, she explained it was time to embark on new career opportunities. The exact last day in her role remains unclear, and at the time of writing, Rakuten had not made any announcements related to the move.

In the US, the state of California continues to blaze its own trail of digital communications and telecom regulation and get things done whilst the federal authorities in Washington DC sit on their hands and watch as proposed meaningful controls wither on the vine of political inertia and partisan self-interest. California was out of the regulation starting gate early. Back in 2018, it passed the first state privacy act and soon followed up that landmark legislation with other new laws that protect children online and require social media platforms to be properly transparent in their dealings with their users and how they harvest and sell personal data. Among the latest proposals are legislation to police the data privacy (mal)practices of data-broking organisations and to prosecute those that break the law. Another is to give consumers the “right to repair” their own comms devices (handsets, tablets etc.) rather than being beholden to the expensive and restrictive practices of device manufacturers. For years, Apple was the restrictor-in-chief, making it nigh-on impossible for the owners of iPhones and other comms equipment to repair their own property, until, very recently, as the “Right to Repair Act” made its way through the state legislature in Sacramento, it had a sudden, miraculous Damascene conversion on the road to Cupertino and became an advocate of providing users with the tools and wherewithal to mend their own kit. Meanwhile, the “Delete Act”, which has already passed both houses of California’s State Assembly and Senate and will shortly be signed into law by California’s Democrat governor, Gavin Newsom, will allow state residents to order data brokers, who make a lot of money from scraping, archiving and manipulating consumer data for sale to a plethora of clients, to cease and desist the harvesting of private data and to delete all data they have pertaining to individuals who want their records to be removed, in their entirety, from a company’s records. Another new law will make technology companies criminally liable if found guilty of knowingly facilitating, aiding or abetting the dissemination of child abuse material. Simultaneously, net neutrality legislation is wending its way through the legalisation processes, as is another new Bill that will require AI tools and systems to be tested for their “safety” before being permitted to be used.

Nigeria continues to be Africa’s biggest ICT (information and communications technology) market. It has the largest number of smartphone users of any African nation and accounts for upwards of 30% of the continent’s internet usage. It is also forecast that the economies of the sub-Saharan African countries will, from this year on into 2028, increase in size by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.4%. This growth will be helped by the projected additional uptake of more than 167 million smartphone subscriptions in the region, of which Nigeria is expected to account for between 55% and 60%. New data, revealed last week, shows that the telecom sector is a massive, and growing, contributor to Nigeria’s gross domestic product (GDP) and, as of the end of June, accounted for 16% of the country’s total GDP. A very impressive figure especially given that Nigeria has a huge oil and gas sector. The statistics were published by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) based on figures calculated by the Nigeria Bureau of Statistics. In a keynote speech, “Success Factors and Barriers to National Broadband and Digital Economy Aspirations”, delivered to the annual Telecom Executives and Regulators Forum (TERF) hosted by the Association of Telecom Companies of Nigeria (ATCON) in Lagos on Thursday last, the executive vice chairman of the NCC, Professor Umar Danbatta, said the Nigerian telecoms sector is making giant strides and added that the rapid progress is largely down to the enlightened and progressive regulatory policies introduced and followed by the NCC. Professor Danbatta said that the country is steadily overcoming various hurdles that, hitherto, have been holding back broadband development and deployment. These range from right-of-way (RoW) issues, the high capital cost of fibre deployment, and problems with multiple taxation regimes. Currently, there are 46 different taxes levied on the telecom sector by different government departments and agencies, many of which, at both state and local levels, don’t even talk to one another! This bureaucratic morass is putting particular strain not only on the industry but also on subscribers, both enterprise and domestic, that have to pay multiple taxes to multiple departments. Professor Danbatta said this and many other regulatory complexities are steadily being surmounted and the digital divide is narrowing daily. He added that regulatory reform is working well and the Nigerian Communications Commission “is confident that we are going to reach 50% broadband penetration by the year end and by 2025, we will meet and possibly surpass the 70% broadband penetration target set in the Nigerian National Broadband Plan for 2020 to 2025.” He confirmed that advances in telecoms technology, and the speed of their deployments, are having a markedly positive effect on Nigeria’s national economy and are driving growth.

"Netflix, SK Broadband bury the hatchet on Network traffic costs","Netflix, SK Broadband bury the hatchet on Network traffic costs","Explainer

South Korean telecom company SK Telecom and Netflix have put an end to their long-drawn legal battle. Both sides have dropped their respective lawsuits and have instead announced a strategic partnership in which they will offer various price plans and products, including bundled packages.

A timeline of events:

November 2019: SK Telecom asked the Korean Communications Commission to look into whether Netflix should be required to pay the telco for increased network traffic.

April 2020: Netflix refused to pay the charge and instead, filed a lawsuit against SK Telecom. It argued that its subscribers were already paying the telco to access the internet.

June 2021: The Seoul District court ruled against Netflix saying that the the broadband company’s offerings are “a service provided at a cost” and it is reasonable for Netflix to be obligated to provide something in return for the service. Netflix still refused to pay and filed an appeal.

October 2021: SK Telecom counter-sued Netflix saying that it had been using SK’s dedicated line (a communications cable or other facility dedicated to a specific application) since 2018 to deliver copious amounts of data-heavy, high-definition video content to viewers from servers in Japan and Hong Kong.

Between March 2022 and April 2023, the case had 18 hearings and was ongoing even as of earlier this month (as noted by Korea University School of Law Professor KS Park in an interview with MediaNama).

What does SK Telecom and Netflix’s partnership entail?

Netflix will be bundled with SK Telecom’s plans and SK Broadband’s (subsidiary of SK Telecom) Internet Protocol TV offerings. (Quick context: IPTV is a service that provides television programming and other video content through internet protocol)

Additional Netflix bundle packages will be introduced for SK Telecom’s subscription service, T Universe.

The duo will also explore opportunities to leverage AI technologies developed by SK Telecom and SK Broadband, such as Conversational UX and Personalized Recommendation Technologies.

Telekom Malaysia (TM) and Korean carrier SK Telecom inked a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to jointly develop the Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) business in Malaysia.

The signing took place at SK Telecom’s headquarters in Seoul in the presence of Fahmi Fadzil, Malaysia’s minister of communications and digital. “I am happy to have witnessed the MoU signing between TM and SK Telecom as there are many opportunities that can be gained from such close cooperation and collaboration. I believe this MoU is a step in the right direction,” said Fahmi.

“Telekom Malaysia remains steadfast in solidifying its stature as Malaysia’s preferred network infrastructure provider, catalyzing digital industry and 4G/5G ecosystem while simultaneously positioning the country to become a digital hub for ASEAN,” said Khairul Liza Ibrahim, TM’s executive vice president.

“Our next step is to provide the means to empower all our customers in Malaysia and the region with multi-access edge computing from all our data centers around the country. Through this collaboration with SK Telecom, TM is stepping up its game to accelerate innovation for the nation’s progress towards a Digital Malaysia,” he added.

In May, Telekom Malaysia announced its withdrawal from a deal to acquire a stake in Malaysia’s 5G network Digital Nasional Berhad (DNB), following the previous announcement by the Malaysian government that it will permit the rollout of a second 5G network in the country from next year.

Telekom Malaysia said it had filed an announcement with the local stock exchange to notify it that the longstop date to fulfill all conditions precedent in the share subscription agreement (SSA) for the subscription of a 20% equity stake in DNB had lapsed. Consequently, the carrier said it had issued a termination notice to DNB, effective immediately.

SK Telecom seeks standards for quantum-safe communication,SK Telecom seeks standards for quantum-safe communication,"SK Telecom noted it will be leading efforts to develop standards for key management of hybrid approaches with quantum key distribution (QKD) and post-quantum cryptography (PQC)

Korean operator SK Telecom said it will promote the development of standards for quantum-safe communications at the International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) Study Group 17 (SG17) meeting, which is being held at the Korea International Exhibition Center (KINTEX), starting this week through September 8.

ITU-T SG 17 is a statutory group of the ITU-T concerned with security, which holds meetings twice a year to develop international standards and technical reports.

At the meeting, SK Telecom says it will be leading efforts to develop standards for key management of “hybrid approaches” with quantum key distribution (QKD) and post-quantum cryptography (PQC), with the aim of reaching quantum-safe communications by combining the strength of QKD and PQC.

The Asian carrier explained that quantum-safe communication refers to the use of technologies that are resistant to attacks by quantum computers, in order to keep information assets secure even after a large-scale quantum computer has been built.

SK Telecom said it is also actively working to develop and commercialize quantum cryptography technologies. Together with SK Broadband and ID Quantique, SK Telecom says it is not only setting standards for the operation of quantum cryptography communication network built with equipment from different manufacturers at the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), but that it has also successfully verified the related technology on the national test network.

“We are excited to lead the establishment of standards for next-generation security technologies that utilize the advantages of quantum key distribution and post-quantum cryptography technologies,” said Ha Min-yong, chief development officer of SK Telecom. “We will continue to make efforts to contribute to the growth of the global quantum cryptography market through active research and business.”

SK Telecom has recently released a 6G white paper that focuses on the key requirements for 6G standardization and the telco’s views regarding the direction of future network evolution.

The Korean carrier said the new white paper contains its views on 6G key requirements and 6G evolution methodology, along with its opinions on the latest trends in frequency standardization. The 6G white paper also provides analysis, development directions and methodologies pertaining to promising 6G use cases, technology trends as well as and candidate frequencies.

Moreover, with the commercialization of 6G, SK Telecom projected that megatrends like AI, power saving and quantum security will spread across all network areas and technologies specialized for each network area—such as radio access network, core network, transport network and aerial network—will be applied and evolved.",https://www.rcrwireless.com/20230830/security/sk-telecom-seeks-standards-quantum-safe-communications,"At the meeting, SK Telecom says it will be leading efforts to develop

South Korea sets out its Open RAN stall,South Korea sets out its Open RAN stall,"South Korea is showing commitment to the somewhat beleaguered Open RAN cause with the inauguration of the Open RAN Industry Alliance (ORIA), a national body that was first announced in April but which now has members and a strategic plan to develop a domestic Open RAN ecosystem in the country.

The ORIA, which will collaborate with international Open RAN industry bodies such as the O-RAN Alliance, brings together the country’s mobile operators, local and international vendors, research firms and academia to collaborate on Open RAN innovations and develop a “public-private ecosystem”, noted South Korea’s Ministry of Science and ICT in an announcement shared last week.

Earlier this year, the ministry announced it would make 1,310bn Korean won ($992m) available in loans and grants to companies and organisations in the digital sector, but it’s unclear what level of funding is being awarded to the ORIA.

The alliance has 30 members, including the country’s three main operators – SK Telecom, KT and LG Uplus – as well as vendors such as Samsung, LG, Nokia, Innowireless, HFR (a private 5G network Open RAN vendor that is one of the alliance co-chairs), FRTech, and Solid, plus Yonsei University, the Korea Institute for Intelligent Information Society Promotion, Korea Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Korea Information and Communication Technology and more. SK Telecom, which has been dabbling with Open RAN for a few years already, will lead the alliance initially, though its Open RAN goals are anything but immediate (we’ll come back to that later).

In the meantime, it seems South Korea doesn’t want to miss the Open RAN boat and let Japan, the US and other nations be the only countries steering the global direction of the Open RAN sector, which is currently growing although slowly, and with concentrated investments in just a few markets (Japan, the US and Germany).

“Amid intensifying competition for international technological supremacy surrounding networks, Open RAN is attracting attention as a key element,” noted minister Lee Jong-ho at the inauguration ceremony held in Pangyo. “We look forward to expanding high-tech cooperation such as international joint research in the future by actively promoting international cooperation related to open LAN technology and standards while creating an ecosystem of mutual cooperation and coexistence,” he added.

The ministry hopes that the formation of the ORIA will help stimulate domestic Open RAN technology product development and help local companies commercialise, and export, their products, though it doesn’t see this happening until later this decade.

Much of the ORIA’s initial activity will centre around testing and validation at the test bed that has already been built by the National Information Society Agency (NIA) in Pangyo and which participated in the O-RAN Alliance Spring Plugfest. That test lab aims to become a qualified open testing and integration centre (OTIC) that can issue awards in the alliance’s certification and badging programs: Currently there are 15 OTICs in operation, including five across Asia (two in China and one each in Japan, Singapore and Taiwan).

In addition, joint Open RAN research is already underway between the ORIA and major US universities (Columbia and NYU), while ORIA will pick up the ongoing research between the ministry and the UK’s DSIT (Department for Science, Innovation and Technology) on power efficiency in Open RAN architectures – see UK government pumps £110m into 5G, 6G R&D

Don't hold your breath...

But this could all be something of a long game, and not an immediate boost, for the companies involved.

In a recent white paper, SK Telecom noted that it has been testing and trialling Open RAN technology for a number of years, and has in-building multi-vendor 5G deployments based on Open RAN specifications, but noted that the Open RAN market has not really taken off “due to somewhat late standardisation of the open fronthaul interface compared to the commercialization of 5G, performance and capacity limitations of virtualized DUs [distributed units], and manufacturers' passive Open RAN policies.” A sobering assessment for the sector!

SK Telecom did, though, note that the performance gap between virtualised and traditional DUs is narrowing, that specification advances are enabling new use cases and broader network operator activity, and that it continues to explore the potential of various deployment options, including more in-building networks and the use of RAN intelligent controller (RIC) platforms.

However, the influential operator also noted that “it is expected that Open RAN will be introduced from the very early stages of commercialization in 6G,” so not for at least six or seven years, according to the operator’s next-generation network timetable – see SK Telecom highlights three ‘megatrends’ for the 6G era.

It added: “SK Telecom considers Open RAN to be a key structure that should be ready from the preliminary stages of 6G adoption for expanding the telecommunications equipment market ecosystem, building flexible networks, enabling IT-based intelligence and cloudification, and reducing TCO [total cost of ownership]. To accomplish this, it is important to reflect in standard specifications for crucial interfaces, including fronthaul, from the initial stage of 6G commercialization through cooperation between mobile operators and manufacturers. On top of that, it is also important to introduce a concrete verification process that minimises performance loss and development time deriving from interoperability issues between equipment from different manufacturers. In addition, mature virtualization technology and corresponding hardware development are required to ensure that Open RAN BSs [base stations] are equivalent to or better than existing BSs in terms of cell capacity, power consumption, as well as TCO. Furthermore, various forms of support for activating the Open RAN ecosystem are needed to lead the 6G Open RAN era… Based on our Open RAN experience in 5G, we plan to continue our collaborative research activities with various players in the ecosystem so that Open RAN can be supported from the early stages of 6G.”

SK Telecom acquires stake in Korean firm AI Persona,SK Telecom acquires stake in Korean firm AI Persona,"SK Telecom became the third largest shareholder in Persona AI

Korean operator SK Telecom said it acquired a stake in local AI assistant developer Persona AI, with the aim of collaborating on the launch of products designed to improve automated customer service facilities for enterprises.

SK Telecom noted that the acquisition is intended to strengthen the telco’s AI Contact Center (AICC) business, which incorporates various AI-related technologies including automated responses, data analysis and speech recognition in customer service or support centers to improve communications.

Persona AI uses its own natural language processing technology to build AI assistants featuring voice recognition, voice engine and sentence analysis. The company offers 24-hour customer service through chatbots and callbots.

SK Telecom did not disclose any financial details of the transaction but noted that it became the third-largest shareholder in Persona AI.

The Korean operator said that it aims to launch new AI-related products with Persona AI using kiosks and robots which can recognize human speech.

SK Telecom also said it will combine its speech recognition technology with Persona AI’s natural language processing tools to build new offering for businesses.

Earlier this month, SK Telecom announced an additional investment of $100 million in Anthropic, an AI safety and research company based in San Francisco, California.

This new investment decision follows the previous investment from SK Telecom Venture Capital (SKTVC), the Silicon Valley-based venture capital arm of SK Telecom.

The Korean company has entered into a partnership agreement with Anthropic with the main aim of building a large language model (LLM) customized for telecom operators. Under the terms of the agreement, SK Telecom and Anthropic will jointly develop a multilingual LLM that supports languages including Korean, English, German, Japanese, Arabic and Spanish.

The partners said they will combine SK Telecom’s expertise in telecommunications with Anthropic’s AI technology, including its AI model, which is called Claude.

Anthropic said it will work with SK Telecom to fine-tune Claude to specific telco use cases, including industry specific customer service, marketing, sales and interactive consumer applications.

The Korean carrier and Anthropic will also work together to bring the multilingual LLM to the Telco AI Platform currently being built by the Global Telco AI Alliance.

SK Telecom, Deutsche Telekom, e& and Singtel have recently formed the Global Telco AI Alliance, with the main aim of creating a new customer experience through the use of AI technology. By removing the need for telcos to build their own LLMs, the Telco AI Platform will enable the members of the Global Telco AI Alliance to develop and offer AI services/apps customized to their respective markets and customers, the partners said.

"What’s up with… Huawei in Germany, SK Telecom, Broadcom and VMware","What’s up with… Huawei in Germany, SK Telecom, Broadcom and VMware","In today’s industry news roundup: Pressure mounts on Germany’s telcos to ditch Huawei and ZTE; SK Telecom takes a stake in artificial intelligence contact centre (AICC) developer Persona AI; the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) gives its final blessing to the union of Broadcom and VMware; and much more!

Deutsche Telekom (DT) and its domestic peers are stuck between a rock and a very expensive hard place. Pressure is mounting on the operators following the public call by a government minister for the telcos to remove Huawei and ZTE equipment from their networks. In an interview with Handelsblatt, the influential daily German business newspaper, Nancy Faeser, federal minister of the interior and community, stated: ""The risks [appertaining to Chinese telecoms equipment] have been known for a long time. Our security authorities have repeatedly warned against one-sided dependencies. I think that the providers had enough time to adapt to this.” Her intervention comes six months after the German government announced it was to examine the deployment of every component of any and all Chinese equipment in national networks regarded by the authorities as having “security implications”. She told Handelsblatt, “We will ban components where there are serious security risks. The network operators will have to act and dismantle the components.” Faesar’s comments are an ominous warning to DT, Vodafone Germany and Telefónica Deutschland (O2) that the federal government will intervene to compel them to rip out Chinese kit if they don’t do so themselves voluntarily – and quickly. DT and its competitors now find themselves impaled on the horns of a dilemma: Whether to do little more than continue with the leisurely removal of bits of peripheral kit whilst retaining Chinese technology in their most important deployments (such as 5G networks), or face government action to force them to act quickly and immediately bear the very high costs of replacing Chinese equipment with more expensive (and more secure) alternatives from European or other western suppliers. In response to a question from the news site Politico, a DT spokesperson, Stephan Broszio, said the precipitate removal of Huawei and other products “would jeopardise mobile coverage and mobile expansion for years to come.” This elicited a quick response from Faesar, who commented, “I don't let the cost argument fool me either.” Germany is Europe’s largest economy, and it remains widely dependent on Chinese technology in its core telco networks. Indeed, a recent report from research house Strand Consult calculated that about 59% of Germany’s 5G radio access network infrastructure installed at the end of last year was manufactured by Chinese companies, mainly Huawei. The minister’s overt intervention marks an abrupt volte-face on the part of the German authorities. Hitherto its laid-back, laissez-faire attitude was greatly at odds with those of the US and its other western allies and the government was reluctant to rock the boat having built what it called a “privileged relationship” with Huawei. However, the European Commission (EC) is pushing EU member states to stop dealing with Chinese technology companies on the grounds that Europe “cannot afford to maintain critical dependencies that could become a weapon against our interests” and Germany is belatedly falling into line. It’s going to cost many billions of euros to pay for the rip-out and replacement. How long will it be before the cries of poverty and pleas for state aid begin?

SK Telecom (SKT) is well on its way to become an ‘AI company’, having unveiled its second investment in an artificial intelligence-enabled company in just a week! The telco has acquired an undisclosed stake in Persona AI, a South Korean developer of artificial intelligence contact centre (AICC) technology, the company announced (in Korean). The telco declined to provide details of the size or value of the investment, but said it is now the third largest stakeholder in Persona AI, enabling SKT to enhance its competitiveness in the AICC market by offering a plethora of solutions, including consulting, infrastructure building and maintenance. The pair will collaborate on a joint AICC business and continue to develop callbot and chatbot products that will utilise SKT’s speech recognition tool Nugu, as well as Persona AI’s language processing and generation technology. New services, such as AI-powered voice recognition robots and kiosks, are also on the development roadmap. With this move, SKT looks to target small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and startups, alongside increasing its market share in the AICC space (which is said to be the fastest-growing enterprise AI market currently, with an annual average growth of nearly 24%). The news comes at the heels of SKT’s announcement of a $100m investment in Anthropic, a San Francisco-based company that is developing a generative AI (GenAI) platform – see SK Telecom to develop telco-optimised LLM with AI partner Anthropic.

Still on AI… UK government officials have reportedly held discussions with Nvidia, AMD and Intel about procuring equipment for national AI research. According to The Telegraph, the government’s plan is to spend up to £100m on “thousands of high-powered” AI chips as the nation seeks to become a global leader in this area. The project, dubbed “AI Research Resource”, would reportedly be led by research and innovation funding body UK Research and Innovation, which is said to be in advanced stages of ordering up to 5,000 graphic processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia. According to the report, the funding of £100m is likely to increase, as the amount is deemed insufficient to cover the government’s goals in the AI space. Read more.

Broadcom is another step closer to acquiring VMware after the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) cleared the proposed $69bn deal. Following an in-depth phase-2 probe that began in April, the regulator gave the deal a green light last month after finding that “Broadcom’s proposed purchase of VMware would not substantially reduce competition in the supply of server hardware components in the UK,” and then sought market responses to its decision. Its in-depth investigation focused on exploring whether the deal could harm the ability of Broadcom’s rivals to compete if the merged entity was to make its products work less well – on which the CMA found that “the potential financial benefit to Broadcom and VMware of making rival products work less well with VMware’s software would not outweigh the potential financial cost in terms of lost business.” Its findings also shrugged off concerns over innovation risks from the deal. “Broadcom and VMware are US-based companies supplying hardware and software used by thousands of businesses and public bodies in the UK. Even if the UK market represents a small proportion of total sales in a merger, the CMA’s job is to scrutinise deals like this thoroughly to ensure they don’t harm competition in the UK”, commented Richard Feasey, chair of the independent panel carrying out the Phase 2 investigation. And now, “having considered the feedback, the [CMA] panel has confirmed its final decision is that the deal does not substantially reduce competition – clearing it to proceed in the UK,” the body noted. Last month, the European Commission also gave the go-ahead for the deal to proceed, under certain conditions. The acquisition is still pending approvals in the US and China.

After 20 years at the helm, Veli-Matti Mattila is stepping down as the CEO at Elisa, which offers communications services in Finland and Estonia, and also owns telecom software vendor Polystar. The company has named the current CEO of national airline Finnair, Topi Manner, as Mattila’s replacement: Manner, who has been an Elisa board member and so knows the company well, will take over by 1 March 2024 at the latest. “Elisa’s board of directors would like to express their sincere thanks to Veli-Matti Mattila for his long and exceptionally meritorious work and for his successful steering of the company in the fast-developing digital world. Under Mattila’s leadership, Elisa has created a continuously evolving culture of excellence that is beyond comparison and has achieved results beneficial for Elisa’s customers, employees and owners, all enjoying the industry’s best shareholder value creation,” the company noted in an announcement to the Helsinki stock exchange. Mattila leaves a very solid company with a reputation for operational innovation for Manner to inherit: For the first six months of this year, Elisa reported a 2% year-on-year increase in revenues to €533m and an operating profit of €116m, up by 3.8%.

In the UK, the country’s uber-regulator to the telecom and media sectors, Ofcom, has initiated a consultation into its proposal to set aside a 448MHz slice of the 27GHz-30Ghz spectrum band for use by the earth-station gateways of satellite broadcast service companies. The idea is that the additional frequency will help improve the speed of data transfers and further increase reach into remote rural areas. The spectrum is available because Hampshire, England-based communications and media infrastructure services company Arqiva recently, for operational reasons and at its own request, petitioned Ofcom to vary the terms of its national 28HGz licence: Ofcom did so and Arqiva then returned 448MHz of now “unassigned spectrum” to the regulator. Thanks to this bonus, Ofcom now proposes to make that unassigned spectrum, and the four guard bands that go with it, available to non-geostationary earth orbit (NGSO) satellite earth station gateways. The same applies to geo-stationary orbit (GSO) permanent earth station (PES) gateways. (Guard bands are narrow frequency ranges used to separate two wider frequency ranges to ensure that both can transmit simultaneously without interfering with one another.) The prime beneficiaries of the newly available extra spectrum will be the satellite broadband operators such as OneWeb and Starlink.

SK Telecom (SKT) and Polygon Labs have entered into a strategic partnership to build a flourishing Web3 ecosystem.

The signing ceremony for the agreement took place at SK Telecom’s headquarters in Seoul and was attended by Oh Se-hyun, Vice President and Head of Web3 CO at SKT, and Marc Boiron, CEO of Polygon Labs.

The agreement outlines several key initiatives that SK Telecom and Polygon Labs will jointly undertake.

A highlight of this collaboration includes the integration of Polygon’s cutting-edge blockchain technology into SK Telecom’s NFT marketplace, TopPort, and its upcoming Web3 wallet. This move will not only enable seamless compatibility with Polygon’s blockchain but will also empower the NFT ecosystem with enhanced scalability and efficiency.

Marc Boiron, CEO of Polygon Labs, said:

“Polygon Labs has been developing optimal blockchain technology for Web3 popularisation, and we see this collaboration with SKT as an important step in providing Web3 experiences to more consumers.”

TopPort was initially launched last year. Creators on the platform will gain the ability to mint Polygon-based NFTs, extending the marketplace’s reach and interoperability with other NFT platforms within the Polygon ecosystem.

Additionally, SKT’s upcoming Web3 wallet – set to debut in the latter half of 2023 – will be integrated with the Polygon network, offering users the capability to engage in NFT trading securely.

The collaboration also extends beyond technical integration. The two companies will actively foster the growth of the Web3 ecosystem by identifying and supporting promising Web3 startups, particularly through Polygon Labs’ subsidiary, Polygon Ventures.

SKT and Polygon Labs will aim to bolster the global presence of Korean Web3 startups and facilitate the entry of leading decentralised apps (dApps) into the domestic market.

Oh Se-hyun, VP and Head of Web3 CO at SKT, commented:

“By combining our experience in blockchain services and Polygon Labs’ blockchain infrastructure and ecosystem, we will be able to create valuable business opportunities and boost the Web3 ecosystem.”

The partnership between SK Telecom and Polygon Labs holds the potential to redefine user experiences and drive innovation across the digital realm. With both companies contributing their strengths, the collaboration could shape the Web3 ecosystem for years to come.

What big Korean telecom's investment in Anthropic AI means,What big Korean telecom's investment in Anthropic AI means,"As the generative AI market matures, foundation model providers continue to receive financial support from global investors.

Earlier this week, South Korea-based telecommunications giant SK Telecom revealed it would invest $100 million in AI safety and research vendor Anthropic. The investment comes three months after the AI startup raised $450 million in Series C funding led by Spark Capital. It also comes a month after software multinational SAP invested in Anthropic and Anthropic competitor Cohere.

Anthropic AI strategy

The investors' interest in Anthropic and others is not surprising, especially since Anthropic's LLM strategy involves more of an enterprise perspective than OpenAI's, according to Futurum analyst Mark Beccue.

""Their approach is to be more enterprise-grade, so I think we might be seeing more investments in different LLMs,"" he said.

Like OpenAI with ChatGPT, Anthropic boasts a generative AI system, which it named Claude. The latest version, Claude 2, was introduced last month.

But unlike OpenAI, Anthropic and Cohere use a ""bring your own data"" approach, which is valuable to enterprises because it can help them avoid using public data or experience leaks of their own data.

The bring-your-own approach means that while the vendor has its own LLM model, enterprises can use their own proprietary data in their applications of the model.

Anthropic also employs an enterprise approach, avoiding some of the problems enterprises face with LLM hallucinations, Beccue said.

In May, Anthropic introduced research on what it calls constitutional AI. Constitutional AI is a method the AI startup uses to help its LLM determine which queries it will answer and which it won't.

Constitutional AI uses AI feedback to evaluate the outputs of LLMs. The system then uses a set of principles -- analogous to how countries' constitutions set forth basic values and principles for governing -- to assess its results.

This focus on accuracy is also appealing to enterprises and others using AI systems because they don't have to worry that the system will regurgitate wrong information, Beccue said.

Meanwhile, one interesting aspect of the investment from SKT is that the telecom service provider giant is also entering the generative AI market.",https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/news/366548355/What-big-Korean-telcos-investment-in-Anthropic-AI-means,"Telecom giant SK Telcom revealed it has invested $100 million in AI

A Collaborative Endeavor in Generative AI

With this investment, SKT signals its definitive entry into the intensely competitive generative AI arena. Both entities have unveiled ambitious plans to collaboratively design a multilingual large language model (LLM) tailored specifically for international telecommunications corporations. Providing strategic direction to this partnership, Jared Kaplan, co-founder and chief science officer of Anthropic, is slated to oversee the customization and the subsequent product trajectory.

Anthropic’s CEO, Dario Amodei, expressed his enthusiasm about the joint venture stating, “SKT has incredible ambitions to use AI to transform the telco industry. We’re excited to combine our AI expertise with SKT’s industry knowledge to build a LLM that is customized for telcos.”

The forthcoming LLM, a brainchild of SKT and Anthropic's partnership, promises to empower four pivotal members of the Global Telco AI Alliance, namely Deutsche Telekom, e&, and Singtel, to present AI solutions that resonate with their unique user base across different markets. This innovative LLM will extend support for an array of languages including English, Korean, German, Japanese, Arabic, and Spanish.

Anthropic’s AI System: Claude

Established in 2021, Anthropic has been trailblazing the AI domain with its groundbreaking system known as Claude. Drawing parallels with OpenAI's Chat GPT, Claude empowers businesses with a suite of functionalities, ranging from generating precise answers and executing workflows to facilitating natural conversations. Its latest offering, Claude Instant 1.2, boasts of assimilating the prowess of its successor, Claude 2, marking the evolution of their second-generation AI chatbot.

Within the telecommunications sector, Claude is anticipated to revolutionize several verticals. SKT foresees its potential applications spanning industry-centric customer service, dynamic consumer interactions, and even sales and marketing strategies.

Emphasizing the transformative potential of the collaboration, SKT’s CEO, Ryu Young-sang, remarked, “Combining our Korean language-based LLM with Anthropic’s strong AI capabilities, we expect to create synergy and gain leadership in the AI ecosystem with our global telco partners.”

It will be a specific variant of Anthropic's wider 'Claude' model, support Korean, English, German, Japanese, Arabic, and Spanish and be overseen by Anthropic co-founder and chief science officer Jared Kaplan.

The resulting AI model will be shared with the Global Telco AI Alliance, an industry group founded last month by Deutsche Telekom, e&, Singtel, and SK Telecom. It will be used for industry-specific customer service, marketing, sales, and interactive consumer applications.

Anthropic is a Californian-based business founded by ex-OpenAI executives that has raised more than $1.5 billion. SK Telecom's investment arm SK Telecom Ventures has previously taken a stake in the company.

Among its other investors is Google, which put $300m into the business - in return for what was originally believed to be an exclusive cloud contract. However, in recent months, Anthropic has become a vocal Amazon Web Services customer.

With the latest investment, Anthropic co-founder and CEO Dario Amodei said: “SKT has incredible ambitions to use AI to transform the telco industry.

The companies will collaborate on the creation of a new AI model tailor-made for the telco industry, which will be shared with choice companies within the market.

Both will also work to fine-tune Anthropic’s Claude chatbot to improve its sector-specific knowledge and performance, for deployment as a chatbot in sales, marketing, and customer services.

To better suit the needs of its wide customer base, the firms will create the LLM in the Korean and English languages, as well as Arabic, German, Japanese, and Spanish.

“With our strategic investment in Anthropic, a global leading AI technology company, we will be working closely with Anthropic to promote AI innovation,” said Ryu Young-sang, CEO at SKT.

“By combining our Korean language-based LLM with Anthropic’s strong AI capabilities, we expect to create synergy and gain leadership in the AI ecosystem together with our global telco partners.”

SKT is the largest telecom operator in Korea. In May, it made an earlier investment in Anthropic for an undisclosed sum.

The multilingual LLM being developed by SKT and Anthropic will be delivered through the platform being developed by the Global Telco AI Alliance. Here its multilingual abilities could be put to use catering to the customers of each respective firm in their first languages.

“SKT has incredible ambitions to use AI to transform the telco industry,” said Dario Amodei, co-founder and CEO at Anthropic.

“We’re excited to combine our AI expertise with SKT’s industry knowledge to build an LLM that is customized for telcos. We see industry-specific LLMs as having high potential to create safer and more reliable deployments of AI technology.”

Anthropic was founded by former members of OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT . It bills itself as an AI “safety and research company”, and has emphasized its focus on safety to distinguish itself from competitors.

Claude, the firm’s answer to the likes of Bard and ChatGPT, is described by Anthropic as a safety-focused chatbot that is less likely to produce harmful results than those of its competitors.

It’s capable of processing up to 100,000 tokens per prompt, compared to up to 32,000 tokens for OpenAI’s GPT-4 or 1,000 for Bard, meaning it can parse huge tracts of text or an entire book if necessary.

Google invested $300 million in Anthropic in February, with Google Cloud entering into an agreement with the firm as Anthropic’s preferred cloud provider.

The move was compared to Microsoft’s $10 billion OpenAI investment , which has proved a landmark moment in the firm’s push to implement AI throughout its product offering.

Since then the firm has led an additional $450 million through an additional funding round, with investors including Spark Capital, Zoom, and Salesforce Ventures.",https://www.itpro.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/sk-telecom-to-invest-dollar100m-in-anthropic-amid-telco-industry-generative-ai-push,"The multilingual LLM being developed by SKT and Anthropic will be delivered

South Korea’s SK Telecom (SKT) has confirmed an additional $100m investment in US-based artificial intelligence (AI) safety and research company Anthropic.

The two companies have also signed a partnership agreement, under which Anthropic will work in collaboration with SKT to develop a multilingual large language model (LLM) customised for telcos.

The LLM will be capable of supporting various languages such as Korean, German, English, Japanese, Spanish and Arabic.

The joint effort will leverage SKT’s deep telecommunications experience, integrated with Anthropic’s AI model ‘Claude’ to address the requirements of the telcos industry.

Claude will be customised for telco applications, for instance, industry-specific marketing, sales, customer service and interactive consumer applications.

This customised model is expected to boost the telco industry’s performance relative to the use of more general models.

The companies will bring this multilingual LLM to Telco AI Platform, which is currently being developed by Global Telco AI Alliance.

SKT CEO Ryu Young-sang said: “By combining our Korean language-based LLM with Anthropic’s strong AI capabilities, we expect to create synergy and gain leadership in the AI ecosystem together with our global telco partners.”

Telco AI platform will eliminate the telco industry’s need to develop their own LLMs, which is both cost and time-consuming, by allowing Global Telco AI Alliance members, including Deutsche Telekom, e& and Singtel, to develop AI services/apps customised for their respective markets and customers.

Anthropic CEO and co-founder Dario Amodei said: “We see industry-specific LLMs as having high potential to create safer and more reliable deployments of AI technology.”

"The New $100M Anthropic Deal with SK Telecom Provides Insight into Where 
LLMs are Headed","The New $100M Anthropic Deal with SK Telecom Provides Insight into Where 
LLMs are Headed","SK Telecom announced a new $100 million investment in Anthropic along with a wide-ranging partnership to develop large language models (LLM) customized to the needs of the telecom industry. The new announcement suggests SK Telecom also participated in the May series C funding round, which totaled $450 million. A translation of the original news release states:

SKT decided on this large-scale investment following its Series C investment in Antropic in May. The two companies also plan to join forces to jointly develop a global telco multilingual LLM (LLM) and build an AI platform in the future. Along with the 'Global Telco AI Alliance' launched last month, this cooperation is expected to add strength to SKT's global AI competitiveness. The two companies plan to jointly develop multilingual LLMs for global telecommunications companies, including Korean, English, German, Japanese, Arabic, and Spanish. SKT plans to further strengthen the performance of its own LLM, while expanding a new multilingual LLM model with Anthropic to demonstrate synergy of cooperation and self-reliance.

Global Telco AI Alliance

The recently formed Global Teleco AI Alliance is a joint initiative between SK Telecom, Deutsche Telekom, e&, and Singtel.

The four telcos will jointly develop the Telco AI Platform by combining their respective technologies and capabilities. The Telco AI Platform is expected to serve as the core foundation for new AI services, including those designed to improve the existing telco services, digital assistants, and super apps that offer a wide range of services.

The clear linkage between the funding round and the industry AI alliance suggests that Anthropic has been selected as a leading technology partner for the four Telco program. In addition to funding, Anthropic is picking up several high-profile telecom customers. You should expect these telcos to offer services that rely, at least in part, on Athropic’s technology. This could significantly expand Athropics’s reach into a wide variety of businesses.

Granted, we have seen similar initiatives during earlier technology platform shifts. Among the most notable were “net markets” formed by leading companies in a variety of industries, such as Covisint for automotive. The track record of these collaborations is mixed at best and it could be several years before we know the impact.

However, it is clearly a positive development. Landing any one of those telcos would be considered a big LLM win, especially with Google and Microsoft so active in the market. Anthropic will surely generate some revenue, prestige, and a lot of industry knowledge through the work, regardless of its long-term prospects.

Industry and Application-Specific LLMs

You have probably noted Synthedia’s thesis about industry specialization. Beyond two or three leading general-purpose LLMs, we expect other providers to develop specialized offerings related to professional functions or industries. Anthropic was already heading down the functional path with its focus on the industry’s largest context window that also operates with surprisingly low latency.

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei commented that further specializations by industry are likely:

SKT has incredible ambitions to use AI to transform the telco industry. We’re excited to combine our AI expertise with SKT’s industry knowledge to build a LLM that is customized for telcos. We see industry specific LLMs as having high potential to create safer and more reliable deployments of AI technology.

At one point it looked like Anthropic might become Google’s back-up plan, when the Mountain View giant invested $300 million in the company with a directly competitive LLM product. However, Anthropic is executing a strategy that is beginning to look different than its tech giant rivals.

That strategy involves a lot of investment ($1.75 - $1.85 billion so far). It also appears to rest on product differentiation. How novel!",https://synthedia.substack.com/p/the-new-100m-anthropic-deal-with,"Global Telco AI Alliance. The recently formed Global Teleco AI Alliance is

Anthropic Gets $100 Million Investment from Korea’s SK Telecom,Anthropic Gets $100 Million Investment from Korea’s SK Telecom,"Artificial intelligence (AI) firm Anthropic has teamed with Korea’s SK Telecom (SKT) to build a large language model for the telecom sector.



The partnership, announced Monday (Aug. 14), will also see SKT invest $100 million into Anthropic, which is backed by Google.

According to a news release from SKT, the companies hope to build a multilingual large language model (LLM) that supports languages, including Korean, English, German, Japanese, Arabic and Spanish, combining SKT’s telecommunication expertise with AI technology like Anthropic’s Claude.

“In particular, Anthropic will work with SKT to fine-tune Claude to telco use cases, including industry specific customer service, marketing, sales, and interactive consumer applications,” the release said. “By customizing the model to the telco industry, telcos will benefit from increased performance relative to the use of more general models.”

The goal is to bring the multilingual LLM to the Telco AI Platform being built by the Global Telco AI Alliance, the release said.

The partnership is happening amid a debate about open-source and closed-source AI models, as PYMNTS wrote last week.

“With closed black-box AI models, any research or results are not reproducible or even verifiable — and the companies behind the models may change them at any time without warning, as well as revoke access,” that report said. “That is why critics of closed-source AI models have called for firms like OpenAI to open up their foundational code.”

However, the source code remains in the hands of the organizations that helped birth it, and thus can’t be manipulated by outside actors. Open-source AI, on the other hand, offers greater interoperability, customization and integration with third-party software or hardware. But this openness could also open the door for misuse and abuse by bad actors.

“The interaction between AI and nuclear weapons, biotechnology, neurotechnology and robotics is deeply alarming,” U.N. Secretary General António Guterres said last month, stressing that “generative AI has enormous potential for good and evil at scale.”

As PYMNTS wrote, some observers — and even some countries — worry that open-source models could help dictators and terrorists that want to weaponize AI. A team of researchers at MIT found that after just an hour, AI chatbots could be convinced to suggest step-by-step instructions for producing four potential pandemic pathogens.

“Widely accessible artificial intelligence threatens to allow people without formal training to identify, acquire, and release viruses that are highlighted as pandemic threats,” the MIT researchers wrote.",https://www.pymnts.com/artificial-intelligence-2/2023/anthropic-gets-100-million-investment-from-koreas-sk-telecom/,"Artificial intelligence (AI) firm Anthropic has teamed with Korea's SK
