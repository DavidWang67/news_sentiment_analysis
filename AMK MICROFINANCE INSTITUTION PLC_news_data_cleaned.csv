​Bakong app tops 8.5 million user accounts ​,​Bakong app tops 8.5 million user accounts ​,"8.5 million accounts “have been using” Bakong e-wallets, with direct and indirect users accounting for around 0.5 million and eight million, respectively. NBC

The number of accounts with the Bakong system, a blockchain-based inter-bank mobile payment platform, has topped the 8.5 million mark, as the Cambodian digital-payment landscape continues to improve, according to National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) assistant governor Chea Serey on February 20.

Speaking at an event, Serey shared that 8.5 million accounts “have been using” Bakong e-wallets, with direct and indirect users accounting for around 0.5 million and eight million, respectively. “Bakong is not just for payment, customers can use [it for] health monitoring,” she said.

As of September, more than 0.5 million customers accounted for transactions in the Bakong system worth $1.2 billion, while direct and indirect transactions totalled two million, she added.

For comparison, Nikkei Asia reported that, through partnerships between the NBC and local banks to operate Bakong and boost adoption, the currency had reached 7.9 million Cambodians by November, directly or through apps offered by partner lenders.

Since its inception, about 6.8 million transactions had been made through Bakong as of November, clocking in at around $2.9 billion, the financial newspaper said.

The NBC officially launched the Bakong system in October 2020.

Cambodia Microfinance Association (CMA) spokesman Kaing Tongngy told The Post on February 22 that all deposit-licence holders among the organisation’s ranks are connected to Bakong, which he said ensures convenience in financial transactions for clients.

These, he said, include four commercial banks and five microfinance deposit-taking institutions (MDI).

For reference, as of end-2022, only five MDIs were operating in the Kingdom, namely Amret Plc, AMK Microfinance Institution Plc, PRASAC Microfinance Institution Plc, LOLC (Cambodia) Plc, and Mohanokor Microfinance Institution Plc.

“Bakong plays a crucial role in connecting all banks and microfinance institutions [MFI] in Cambodia by providing efficiency and convenience for clients while ensuring fair competition among financial institutions.

“Bakong provides a platform for innovation and growth where other financial and non-financial services can grow upon,” he said, boasting that CMA members give constant priority to development, innovation and applicability for clients.

The system allows for real-time fund transfer at no transaction costs between accounts at financial institutions, Tongngy said.

“We [have] also see[n] rapid adoption [by] merchant[s] throughout the Kingdom, including rural areas, starting to adopt KHQR for payment,” he said, referring to a universal quick response (QR) code system that the NBC says was created for retail payments in Cambodia as well as cross-border transactions within the ASEAN bloc.

On January 4, 2022, Nikkei announced that Bakong had won one of the Awards for Excellence in the 2021 Nikkei Superior Products and Services Awards “for its innovative technology and impact on the country’s economic and social development”.

The NBC’s Serey has often laid stress on Bakong’s purpose of enabling interoperability between banks and financial institutions, making digital payments easier, safer, more efficient and more cost-effective.

She told Nikkei on the occasion: “This interoperability between different players in the financial system would not only create added value to end-users in terms of the services but also help bridge the [gap between] banked and unbanked [and] rural and urban, thus creating social cohesion.”

“This is particularly noticeable among the migrant workers and students who leave their home villages to work or study in the urban areas and need financial connection with their family.”",https://www.phnompenhpost.com/business/bakong-app-tops-85-million-user-accounts,"The number of accounts with the Bakong system, a blockchain-based

Agricultural communities can look towards reducing production costs via low interest loans following a subsidiary loan agreement between state-owned Agricultural and Rural Development Bank (ARDB) and three financial institutions.

The agreement was signed with one commercial bank and two microfinance institutions (MFI) – Cambodia Post Bank Plc, Chamroeun Microfinance Plc and AMK Microfinance Institution Plc – under the Cambodia Agricultural Sector Diversification Project (CASDP) on August 15.

The agreement is aimed at propping up the agricultural sector, a mainstay of the Cambodian economy, at a time when the world is facing a food crisis.

Cambodia Rice Federation president Song Saran told The Post on August 16 that the financing scheme reflected the government’s commitment to ensure low-interest financing for farmers and farming communities.

“I see this as good news under the new financing context, which shows that the government is committed to working with financial institutions such as microfinance institutions which are located close to agricultural communities, as well as farmers, to provide easy and efficient financing.

“I support the fact that ARDB has set out this policy to help the farming community as much as possible, enabling them to access appropriate financing at an appropriate interest rate,” Saran said.

Mak Chamroeun, chairman of AgriBee (Cambodia) Plc, also praised the government institution and financial institutions for their efforts in financing the agricultural sector.

“I believe that providing low-interest loans to farmers or to key players in the agricultural sector is necessary to keep the cost of farmers’ agricultural products low, allowing them to be competitive in the market,” he said.

ARDB deputy director-general Chan Seiha told reporters at the event that CASDP has a capital of $30 million, which is funded by the World Bank to focus on agriculture, except rice for five years.

“We have collaborated by providing our three partners with us being the principal so they can work directly [with the farming communities],” he said.

Seiha said the “wholesale” loans provided by the ARDB to the three financial institutions are at an interest rate of five per cent per annum, with no service charge.

“However, the interest rate that the three institutions provide to customers depends on the policy of each institution, the farmers and the actual farming community,” he added.",https://www.phnompenhpost.com/business/farmers-can-seek-low-interest-loans-trim-production-costs-after-ardb-deal,"Agricultural communities can look towards reducing production costs via low

​AMK sells 80 per cent stake to bank from Shanghai​,​AMK sells 80 per cent stake to bank from Shanghai​,"AMK Microfinance, the country’s fifth largest such institution by total assets last year, has sold 80 per cent of its stake to Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank (SCSB) for an undisclosed sum, an AMK executive confirmed on Thursday.

While the value of the deal was not publicised, AMK’s annual report last year revealed that its assets were worth $282.8 million.

AMK CEO Kea Borann told The Post on Thursday that the acquisition had been approved by the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) on Tuesday.

Even though SCSB now holds the majority stake in AMK, Borann said the firm will continue to operate under the AMK name with the same management team. He said the new shareholder will keep AMK’s operations the same as before and focus on the rural market.

“We believe that a strong banking system needs a shareholder with huge capital, and so SCSB is the right candidate to leverage AMK to the next step.""

“When we have a major source of funds and experts waiting to help, AMK will have more opportunities to diversify our products and services and serve our customers, especially those in rural areas,” Borann said.

An AMK media release said there were many investors negotiating to buy a stake in the company, but it decided to sell a majority stake to SCSB because both seek to use financial services to help improve the peoples’ livelihood.

An annual report at the end of last year showed AMK’s total borrowings stood at $214 million – an increase from $161 million at the end of 2016.

AMK’s total deposits were at $121.6 million at the end of last year. This was up from the $90.6 million recorded the year before.

Despite the growing numbers, AMK saw a decline in net profit last year, down to $5.27 million from $6.63 million the year before.

Last week, Samic Microfinance, an institution that was worth $17.3 million last year, sold its entire operations to South Korea-based NongHyup Bank.

After the acquisition, Samic was renamed NongHup Finance Cambodia following acquisition approvals from the NBC and the Cambodian Ministry of Commerce.",https://www.phnompenhpost.com/business/amk-sells-80-cent-stake-bank-shanghai,"AMK Microfinance, the country's fifth largest such institution by total
