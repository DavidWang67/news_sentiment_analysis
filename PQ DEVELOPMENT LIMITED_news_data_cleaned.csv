Oral Cholera Vaccine to be manufactured by Biological E. Limited for India and international markets

March 20, 2024, SEOUL, Republic of Korea and HYDERABAD, India — The International Vaccine Institute (IVI), an international organization with a mission to discover, develop, and deliver safe, effective, and affordable vaccines for global health, today announced that it has commenced a technology transfer of simplified Oral Cholera Vaccine (OCV-S) to Biological E. Limited (BE), a leading India-based Vaccines and Pharmaceutical Company.

Following the signing of a technology license agreement in November last year, IVI has begun providing the technical information, know-how, and materials to produce OCV-S at BE facilities and will continue to support necessary clinical development and regulatory approvals. IVI and BE entered this partnership during an unprecedented surge of cholera outbreaks worldwide and aim to increase the volume of low-cost cholera vaccine in India as well as the global public market.

IVI will complete the technology transfer by 2025 and the oral cholera vaccine will be manufactured for India and international markets by Biological E. Limited.

Dr. Jerome Kim, Director General of IVI, said: “In an era of heightened risk of poverty-associated infectious diseases such as cholera, the world needs a sustainable source of high-quality, affordable vaccines and committed manufacturers to supply them. We are pleased to partner with Biological E., a company with a proven history of making life-saving vaccines accessible globally, to address this supply gap and protect communities from this deadly, though preventable, disease.”

Ms. Mahima Datla, Managing Director, Biological E. Limited, said: “We are glad to be in collaboration with IVI for the manufacture of simplified Oral Cholera Vaccine. Our efforts are aimed to not only combat the disease but to also be part of a sustained legacy of innovation, collaboration, and health stewardship. Together with IVI, we are happy to be shaping a healthier and more resilient future by making this vaccine accessible globally.”

This technology transfer and licensing agreement is the sixth of its kind for IVI, transferring such technology to manufacturers in India, the Republic of Korea, Bangladesh, and South Africa. All these partnerships have led to or seek to achieve, pre-qualification (PQ) from the World Health Organization, a designation that enables global agencies such as UNICEF to procure the vaccine for the global market. BE already has 9 vaccines with WHO PQ in its portfolio, and IVI and BE will pursue WHO PQ for OCV-S as well, following national licensure in India.

Dr. Julia Lynch, Director of IVI’s Cholera Program, said: “The cholera situation is dire, and the availability and use of oral cholera vaccine is an essential part of a multifaceted approach to cholera control and prevention, especially as outbreaks increase and the global vaccine supply remains strained. With more manufacturers like BE entering the market, the future supply situation looks strong. IVI remains committed to ensuring the availability of the oral cholera vaccine and to developing new and improved vaccines that are equally safe, effective, and affordable and made around the world, for the world.”

OCV-S is a simplified formulation of OCV with the potential to lower production costs while increasing production capacity for current and aspiring OCV manufacturers. IVI’s development of OCV-S and ongoing technology transfers are part of an institutional strategy to confront cholera with 3 main goals: 1) Ensure supply of OCV 2) Improve cholera vaccines 3) Support OCV use and introduction. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has been supporting IVI’s cholera program since 2000 and is funding this latest technology transfer to BE.

"2023 Most Disruptive MBA Startups: In Good Company, Georgia Tech (Scheller)","2023 Most Disruptive MBA Startups: In Good Company, Georgia Tech (Scheller)","Industry: Professional development and training with a focus on the service industry.

Founding Student Name(s): Sarah Naumann and Amanda Shojaee

Brief Description of Solution: Integrated employment is our solution to a lack of reliable employees in the service industry. This happens when employers put into place the right accommodations to support employees with disabilities to succeed on the job. This, in turn, allows for a more complete and diverse team that sticks around for the long run. These added supports are typically inexpensive, like providing picture charts instead of written task lists or spacing out breaks to help with varying levels of stamina.

By supporting and accommodating employees with disabilities, businesses not only enhance job satisfaction and retention but also save money by decreasing recruitment and training expenses. This means the idea goes beyond “good intentions.” It’s good business!

At In Good Company, we collaborate with service industry VPs and executives to weave integrated employment into their company’s core. Additionally, we guide their general managers on concrete steps to actualize this vision.

Funding Dollars: $25Kfrom Fusen (Full investment offer: $500K)

What led you to launch this venture? I grew up with dear friends who had disabilities, which led me to become a 2nd grade teacher at a specialized school in Texas for students with learning differences. All the while, I couldn’t stop thinking about the challenges my students would face when they grew up. Would they have trouble finding jobs? Would their communities embrace them and receive the tremendous value she knew they had to offer?

When the pandemic hit, I realized I had a dream, and could either sit on it or do something with it. So, I chose to pack up my classroom and head to business school at the Georgia Tech Scheller College of Business in Atlanta so I could develop the skills I lacked and find the gifted people she needed to build a solution.

I met my co-founder, Amanda, in the MBA program. Amanda has a passion for researching and solving social problems by means of business solutions. Together, we’ve made a great team over the last two years, getting to the heart of the problems the adult disabled population faces, as well as the problems business owners in service industries face. Our findings have led us to see that these two groups’ challenges can be solved with one beautiful solution.

What has been your biggest accomplishment so far with venture? It was securing an investment as well as our first client in the hospitality industry within six months of incorporation and getting to help solve their challenges and achieve their goals.

What has been the most significant challenge you’ve faced in creating your company and how did you solve it? I think the biggest challenge has been the reality that we are limited in our time and resources and have to make decisions about our priorities. We are focusing on the right things at the right time. It’s a challenge that we felt during the MBA program as well – with classes, social events, and extracurriculars, how do you balance it all?

For the company, we’re solving it by focusing on establishing OKRs (objectives and key results) and holding ourselves accountable to reaching them. It’s a constant challenge, but focusing on the OKRs for each quarter has improved how we manage our time and resources significantly.

How has your MBA program helped you further this startup venture? The most helpful part of the MBA program has been the people we’ve connected with along the way, especially the faculty and affiliated mentors through the different Georgia Tech programs we participated in, like Georgia Tech CREATE-X, Sustainable-X, and the Institute for Leadership and Social Impact. Their experience and advice have been so valuable and continues even after graduation.

What founder or entrepreneur inspired you to start your own entrepreneurial journey? How did he or she prove motivational to you?

Sarah’s reflection: When I was in 1st grade, my dad left his stable CPA job to open a restaurant. For two decades, I watched him take risks, invest in his employees and guests, and come home exhausted but still smiling. Although nearly all our family and friends advised against it, my grandfather, a small business owner himself, supported him.

With just that single vote of confidence, my dad took a leap of faith. Seeing the success of his business today, it’s easy to overlook the initial risks he took. Now, as a business owner myself, I’ve gained a deeper appreciation for his journey, inspiring me to be a risk-taker who has greater hope for the future than fear of losing what was familiar and safe.

Amanda’s reflection: To be honest, I entered the MBA program never thinking I would be doing what I am doing today. I did a traditional MBA internship during the program and had my eye on corporate recruiting once I reached the second year of the program. Sarah’s passions were the real inspiration for me considering an alternative career. Getting to be a witness and contributor to her rapid growth and development as a leader are my motivation to do the best I can as a co-founder and continue pushing forward.

Which MBA class has been most valuable in building your startup and what was the biggest lesson you gained from it? Our product development class. This is where we had our first opportunity working on a project together and where I first learned about Sarah’s passions and eventually joined her as she pursued those passions full time. We realized Sarah’s strength in ideation and vision coupled with drive for discovery and iteration made for a strong team.

What professor made a significant contribution to your plans and why? Karthik Ramachandran was our product development professor and became our advisor when we pursued an independent research study to focus on customer discovery and test our hypotheses. Not only did he advise us through our first pro-bono client, he also brought us in with two other students working on their own ventures so we could share our experiences and learn from each other. It was the highlight of our last semester in the MBA program.

How has your local startup ecosystem contributed to your venture’s development and success?

Our experience with the Sustainable-X pitch competition, which led us to participate in CREATE-X Start-Up Launch program at Georgia Tech, has been so helpful in giving us a community of founders, monetary resources, advising, and mentors who we still are in touch with today. Additionally, we connected with the Atlanta Tech Village, and used their monthly opportunities for female founders to practice pitching in a friendly environment.

What is your long-term goal with your startup? Our long-term goal is to grow our platform in its features and engagement and also grow our team!

Highlights from the work include:

Column test work conducted by McClelland Laboratories, Inc. ("" MLI "") of Reno, Nevada on PQ core from 2022 drilling returned (i) average leach recoveries of 65% (range 56.1% to 77.8%) for -50 mm (2 inch) feed size, and (ii) average recoveries of 72% (range 64% to 81.8%) for 80%-12.7 mm (1/2 inch) feed size.

"") of Reno, Nevada on PQ core from 2022 drilling returned (i) average leach recoveries of 65% (range 56.1% to 77.8%) for -50 mm (2 inch) feed size, and (ii) average recoveries of 72% (range 64% to 81.8%) for 80%-12.7 mm (1/2 inch) feed size. Cyanide consumption was low and expected to be below 0.4 kilogram NaCN/metric ton ("" kgNaCN/mt "") of ore for 12.7 mm crush size and hydrated lime consumption of between 0.7 to 2.0 kilogram/metric ton ("" kg/mt "") of ore during commercial leaching.

"") of ore for 12.7 mm crush size and hydrated lime consumption of between 0.7 to 2.0 kilogram/metric ton ("" "") of ore during commercial leaching. ""Load permeability"" tests on residual leached 12.7 mm material indicated adequate permeability for commercial heap leach stack heights of up to 91 meters (300 feet) without any pretreatment agglomeration.

Western Exploration CEO, Darcy Marud, said, ""Western Exploration is pleased that the Doby George metallurgical results report high leach recovery rates that are consistent with past metallurgical work. The completed test work is a key milestone identified in the 2021 technical report and a key component needed to advance the Doby George deposits towards a pre-feasibility study.""

2023 Column Leach Metallurgy Results

A detailed heap leach testing program was conducted on drill composites representing gold bearing oxide and mixed materials collected from the Doby George deposit with PQ drilling in 2022 (Figure 1). Agitated cyanidation bottle roll tests were conducted on a total of 46 drill core composites to obtain preliminary information regarding heap leach amenability and ore variability. The results of the bottle roll tests were reported in the Company's news release dated July 10, 2023 and entitled ""Western Exploration Reports Average of 69.3% Gold Extraction from First Round of Metallurgical Test Work at Doby George, Aura Project, NV"". Based on the results of the bottle roll testing, a total of seven master (column test) composites were prepared for column leach testing. Five oxide and one blended oxide/mixed column leach tests were conducted at -50 mm (2 inch) and 80%-12.7 mm (1/2inch) feed sizes. A seventh composite, representing mixed material from deep within the West Ridge area, was tested at an 80%-12.7 mm feed size. The column tests were conducted to determine gold recovery, recovery rate, reagent consumptions and feed size sensitivity under simulated heap leaching conditions. Summary results are presented in Table 1.

All five oxide composites were amenable to simulated heap leach cyanidation treatment at both feed sizes evaluated. This includes composites from the West Ridge and Daylight areas. Gold recoveries obtained at the -50 mm feed size ranged from 56.1% to 77.8% and averaged 64.3% in 113 to 133 days of leaching. Crushing the composites to 80%-12.7 mm in size was effective in increasing gold recoveries. Gold recoveries obtained from the oxide composites at the -12.7 mm feed size ranged from 64.0% to 81.8% and averaged 71.6% in 114 to 134 days.

A single composite of material from the Twilight area was tested. That composite included a blend of oxide and mixed material. Gold recoveries obtained from the composite at the -50 mm and -12.7 mm feed sizes were 67.9% in 113 days and 72.9% in 120 days.

A single composite of deep mixed material from the West Ridge area was column tested at the -12.7 mm size. That material was not amenable to heap leaching at that feed size. The column test gold recovery was only 6.1% and leaching was complete in less than 30 days. This composite had an elevated sulfide sulfur content (0.47%) and relatively low CN/FA ratio (7.7% Au). Locking of gold in sulfide minerals may be the cause for the refractory nature of the material.

Gold recovery rates were moderate, and with the exception of composite 4838-047, were not particularly sensitive to feed size (Figure 2-Figure 4). In the case of composite 4838-047, crushing from -50 mm to -12.7 mm in size significantly increased the gold recovery rate. In all cases gold extraction was progressing at a slow rate (~1%/month average). On average after 60 days of leaching, approximately 95% of the final gold recovery was completed for the 80%-12.7 mm feed size and 92% of the final gold recovery for the -50 mm feed size.

Oxide and oxide/mixed column test cyanide consumptions were moderate and ranged from 0.41 to 1.11 kgNaCN/mt of ore. Commercial consumptions should be significantly lower and would probably not exceed 0.4 kgNaCN/mt ore for heap leaching of the oxide material at an 80% -12.7 mm feed size. The 0.7 to 2.0 kg/mt hydrated lime added before leaching was sufficient for maintaining protective alkalinity during leaching.

Fixed wall hydraulic conductivity tests conducted on the -12.7 mm feed size column leached residues showed that the material types tested are expected to be adequately permeable for commercial heap stack heights to up to 91 meters (330 feet) without the need for agglomeration.

MLI recommends additional column leach test work on low grade drill composites to further study the relationship of grade and recovery, the evaluation of high-pressure grinding roll crushing on higher grade material and additional ore variability bottle roll test work for geometalurigical modeling of the deposit.

About Doby George

Doby George is one of the highest-grade, undeveloped open pit heap leach resources in Nevada and one of three mineral deposits on Western Exploration's 100% owned Aura gold-silver project located in Nevada (the ""Aura Project""). The Aura Project is located 32 kilometers north of the Jerritt Canyon mine, which has been in continual operation since 1981. The deposit is an outcropping, high-grade sediment-hosted mineral deposit, with multiple zones of mineralization identified by drilling in a 1.7 x 0.8 kilometer area (see Figure 5). The zone of oxidation extends 150 to 200 meters below surface, while limited deep drilling has encountered unoxidized gold mineralization at depths of over 600 meters below surface.

Homestake Mining Company initially discovered the deposit in the mid-1980s. Since that time, 836 drill holes have been completed, totaling 116,355 meters of drilling. This includes 83 drill holes totaling 23,760 meters that were drilled by Western Exploration LLC between 1998 and 2022. Metallurgical test work completed on oxidized material by Homestake Mining Company, Independence Mining Company, and Atlas Precious Metals Inc., has indicated favorable metallurgy for standard cyanide heap leach processing. Results from the previous metallurgical testing completed on 52 bottle rolls and 23 column leach samples indicate that heap leach gold recoveries approaching seventy percent can be expected via a crush of 1 to 1.5 inches.

In addition to an established mineral resource estimate (as determined in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (""NI 43-101"")) as outlined in the NI 43-101 technical report entitled ""2021 Updated Resource Estimates and Technical Report for the Aura Gold-Silver Project, Elko County, Nevada"" dated October 20, 2021 (with an effective date of October 14, 2021) (the ""Technical Report""), the Aura Project has well established infrastructure including year-round accessibility by highway and county-maintained road and nearby access to water and electricity (see Figure 6). Western Exploration has exploration, development, and mining rights on 930 hectares of privately owned land through a mineral lease agreement with a local landowner and may purchase those fee lands at any time for the development of Doby George.

The 6,000-hectare Aura Project has identified mineral resources in three different deposits (Doby George, Gravel Creek, and Wood Gulch), as supported by Technical Report (see Table 2 below).

For Western Exploration legacy samples, standards and blanks and duplicates were generally included approximately every 20th sample for QA/QC purposes by the Company as well as the lab. Approximately 5% of sample pulps are sent to secondary laboratories for check assay. QA/QC controls are not fully documented for legacy assays from the 1980s and 1990s but Mine Development Associates conducted rigorous evaluation of adjacent assay intervals as part of the Technical Report resource calculations. Please see below under the heading ""Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information"" for further details regarding the risks facing Western Exploration.

KLM Geophysics completed a three-line induced polarization & resistivity (IP) survey over the Doby George area in July and August 2023. Oversight of acquisition & processing was done by Western Exploration LLC (""WEX"") geologists and R. Ellis acting as consultant to WEX. Data were collected using a pole-dipole (PDP) array with electrode spacing of 200 metres designed to acquire data to depths of 500 metres southwest of the Doby George mineralization. Data processing and editing was done by S. Walker of Campbell & Walker Geophysics Ltd. acting as consultant to KLM Geophysics. 2D inversion modeling was done by S. Walker using the UBC code and by R. Ellis using the Seequent VOXI and Loki Res2DInv codes. The results were comparable although the VOXI and UBC inversion were most similar and are used for interpretation. Targeting comments in this press release are based on recommendations presented by R. Ellis.

Metallurgical Test Work

Interval Preparation and Assay

A total of 431 drill hole interval samples were received for preparation and assay. The samples were whole PQ drill core from nine drill holes (DGC789 through DGC797) with an average length of 2.0 meters. Each interval sample was jaw-crushed to a nominal 50 mm (2 inches) topsize. Crushed intervals were each thoroughly blended by repeated coning and were quartered to obtain a split for finer crushing. Each one-quarter split was crushed to approximately 2 mm in size and was blended and split to obtain 0.3 kg for pulverization. Each 0.3 kg split was pulverized to >95%-106µm (150-mesh) and used for assay.

QC samples (blanks and standards) were provided by WEX, with the drill hole interval samples. The blanks were crushed (-19 mm) rock samples, which generally weighed <1 kg each. Those samples were prepared with the corresponding drill interval samples in the order specified by WEX (as reported in the assay certificates). Because of their size and fineness, only the crushing to 2 mm in size, splitting and pulverizing was required for the blanks. The standards were received as assay pulps and were submitted for assay with the drill hole interval assay pulps in the order specified by WEX. MLI internal blanks and standards were also assayed as part of MLI's normal QA/QC protocols.

Interval samples were assayed, using conventional fire assay fusion (30 g)/AA method to determine gold and silver content. Samples that assayed above 10 gAu/mt were reassayed using conventional fire assay fusion (30 g)/gravimetric finish method to determine gold content. All samples that assayed greater than 0.05 gAu/mt were analyzed using a standard cyanide shake analysis procedure to determine gold content. The cyanide solubility procedure used was an ambient, 1 hour shake test at 33.3% solids with a 5.0 gNaCN/L solution.

Column Test Composite Preparation

Once bottle roll test results were reviewed, samples were selected for preparation of seven column test composites. Coarsely crushed (nominal 50 mm) drill interval rejects were combined to produce composites 4838-047 through 4838-053 and 4838-055.

Each of composites 4838-052 and 4838-053 were thoroughly blended by repeated coning and were quartered to obtain appropriately weighted splits, which were combined to produce column test composite 4838-054. Remaining material from composites 4838-052 and 4838-053 was retained for potential future testing.

Each column test composite was thoroughly blended by repeated coning and was quartered to obtain approximately 300 kg for a column leach test (210 kg from Comp. 4838-050, because of sample limitations) and 50 to 75 kg for a head screen analysis. Approximately 95 to 190 kg of each composite was also split for crushing to 12.7 mm in size.

Each split for finer crushing (95 - 190 kg, depending on sample availability) was stage-crushed to 80%-12.7 mm in size to obtain 75 kg for a column leach test, 20 kg for a head screen analysis and triplicate 2 kg samples for head assay. A second 75 kg split was also taken from composite 4838-048, for a duplicate column leach test.

Each head assay split was crushed to minus 2mm in size and was blended and split to obtain

0.3 kg for generation of an assay pulp. Each 0.3 kg sample was pulverized to >95%-106µm in size and used for generation of head assay pulps.

The ore charges did not require agglomeration pretreatment. Lime (0.7 - 2.0 kg/mt) was mixed with the dry ore charges before column loading procedures. Lime additions were based on bottle roll test lime requirements. Ore charges were placed into the 30 cm I.D. (-50mm feeds) or 15 cm I.D. (12.7mm feeds) x 3m (10') high leaching columns in a manner to minimize particle segregation and compaction.

Leaching was conducted by applying cyanide solution (0.5-gram NaCN/Liter) over the ore charges at a rate of 9.6 Liter per hour/m2 (0.004 gallons per minute/ft2) of column cross-sectional area. Pregnant effluent solutions were collected each 24-hour period. Pregnant solution volumes were measured by weighing, and samples were taken for gold and silver analysis using conventional ICP methods. Free cyanide concentration and pH were determined for each pregnant solution. Pregnant solutions were pumped through a three-stage carbon circuit for adsorption of dissolved gold values. Barren solution, with appropriate make-up reagent, was applied to the ore charges daily. After leaching, freshwater rinsing was conducted to remove residual cyanide (county requirement) and to recover dissolved gold values. Moisture required to saturate the ore charges (in process solution inventory), for agglomeration and retained mois­tures were determined. Apparent ore bulk densities were measured before and after leaching.

Drain down tests were conducted after rinsing was complete. Tests were conducted by terminating solution application, and at that time, measuring drain volume. Drain volumes were collected and measured periodically by weighing until drain down was complete.

After leaching, rinsing, and draining, residues were removed from the columns and moisture samples were taken immediately. Remaining leached residues were air dried, blended and split to obtain a sample for a tail screen analysis. Tail screens were conducted using the same procedures and size fractions as for the head screens to determine residual gold and silver content and distribution, and to obtain recovery by size fraction data. An additional 20 kg split was taken from each 12.7mm feed size column residue for load-permeability testing.

Load-permeability splits were shipped to NewFields in Elko, NV for fixed-wall saturated hydraulic conductivity (load-permeability) tests.

Cautionary Statements Regarding Estimates of Mineral Resources

This news release uses the terms measured mineral resources, indicated mineral resources, and inferred mineral resources as a relative measure of the level of confidence in the resource estimate. Readers are cautioned that mineral resources are not mineral reserves and that the economic viability of mineral resources that are not mineral reserves has not been demonstrated. The mineral resource estimate disclosed in this news release may be materially affected by geology, environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing, or other relevant issues. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of the inferred mineral resources will ever be upgraded to the category of indicated mineral resource or measured mineral resource. The mineral resource estimate is classified in accordance with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum's ""CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves"" (CIM) incorporated by reference into NI 43-101. Under NI 43-101, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies or economic studies except for preliminary economic assessments. Readers are cautioned not to assume that further work on the stated resources will lead to mineral reserves that can be mined economically.

Inferred mineral resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether they can be mined legally or economically. On October 31, 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted new mining disclosure rules (""S-K 1300"") that are more closely aligned with current industry and global regulatory practices and standards, including NI 43-101, although there are some differences in the two standards. Accordingly, information concerning mineral deposits contain in this release may not be comparable with information made public by U.S. companies that report in accordance with S-K 1300.

WHO Adds SWIPHA Nigeria‘s Zinc Sulphate To Pre-qualified Medicines,WHO Adds SWIPHA Nigeria‘s Zinc Sulphate To Pre-qualified Medicines,"The World Health Organisation (WHO) has added Pediatric Zinc Sulphate Tablet (20mg dispersible tablet) manufactured by Swiss Pharma (SWIPHA) Nigeria Limited, to its list of Pre-Qualified medicines.

The director-general, National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), Prof. Mojisola Christianah Adeyeye, who disclosed this in a press briefing on Tuesday, in Lagos, said this laudable feat is the outcome of meaningful collaboration between the Swiss Pharma Nigeria Limited and NAFDAC.

Every year, billions of dollars worth of medicines are purchased by or through international procurement agencies for distribution in resources-limited countries. The advantages of having a Pre-Pre-qualification (PQ) in terms of trade cannot be overemphasized, the DG averred, adding that it helps to ensure that medicines supplied by procurement agencies meet acceptable standards of quality, safety and efficacy.

„WHO‘s PQ is the fundamental prerequisite for quality assurance of key medical products to be purchased by UN agencies, Global Funds and United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Today, SWIPHA has this opportunity. This is a new source of business and it will generate foreign currency to the company and Nigeria.

„PQ helps improve market access or business opportunities and capacity utilization for the company. SWIPHA has the advantage to compete successfully for contract manufacture for local and multinational organization. It also help to create health and economic impact in Nigeria by ensuring an increased availability of quality, efficacious and safe medicines and reducing reliance on imports for public health intervention,“ she revealed

The DG however encouraged other frontline local drug manufacturers to emulate this feat through harmonization of collective and synergy of effort with the Agency, while assuring that NAFDAC‘s door is open to serious minded manufacturers.

“SBTDC is a great resource. The expertise and connections that SBTDC offers are great benefits; plus, SBTDC is part of the App State family.” Lynn Houston ’86, president and founder of Zzzz Box Mattress

With the company’s growth, Houston, who serves as president of Zzzz Box Mattress, began looking to buy a business to vertically integrate manufacturing for the company in 2019. He was introduced to SBTDC by the vice president of Zzzz Box Mattress’ bank — also an App State graduate. For the next two years, Houston actively worked with SBTDC to acquire a manufacturing company.

“SBTDC is a great resource,” said Houston. “The expertise and connections that SBTDC offers are great benefits; plus, SBTDC is part of the App State family — myself, my wife, my two sons and my two daughter-in-laws are all App State graduates.”

Even though the acquisition of the manufacturing company did not go through, the connections and process of building a business model were a great learning experience that has made Houston a better business owner.

“I often tell people that I feel like I earned an MBA through the experience with SBTDC,” Houston said. “I keep in contact with the consultants whom I was introduced to by SBTDC. I also keep in contact with Brooklyn Dellinger, as I continue to look at future scenarios for my company.”

PQ CNC WORKS

In 2019, Jorge and Sara Mora founded PQ CNC WORKS to offer a full suite of precision machining products. In just over three years, the three-person small business in Maiden has grown to offer computerized numerical control (CNC) machining, computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing capabilities and range analysis of parts and their application on all industries — from complex machines parts to production parts.

The Moras, who serve as PQ CNC WORKS’ lead engineer and designer, respectively, were drawn to SBTDC because of the opportunities it offers to small businesses — even those already in operation — by providing tools to reach the next level. Through SBTDC’s counseling services, the Moras gained valuable knowledge in finances, management, funds acquisition and financial management.

“As a small company — and as people — we have found SBTDC to be an invaluable contribution,” said Sara. “We are aware that if we had to draw up a budget to pay for this type of consultancy privately, we would not be able to do so. SBTDC has not only helped us in the organization of our business, but also personally — to grow, to communicate better and to learn financial terms.”

Through face-to-face and virtual meetings with SBTDC, the Moras have maintained constant communication with SBTDC Business Counselor Anna Jackson for reviews of PQ CNC WORKS’ financials, advice on upcoming projects and production projections. SBTDC recently helped with the company’s expansion, as PQ CNC WORKS has grown threefold over the past two years.

“In the SBTDC, we have found a professional team — family — we can turn to, to gain quality information and support,” Jorge said. “We are immigrants who are still learning the (English) language; however, that has not limited SBTDC in any way to offer us help.”

Thar coal to be linked with PQ thru rail system,Thar coal to be linked with PQ thru rail system,"ISLAMABAD: The government has decided to link Thar coal and Port Qasim (PQ) with Pakistan Railways network through Rs 58.240 billion project in order to provide bulk transportation facilities as per requirement of the economy.

Sources said that the PC-I of the project has been prepared and is expected to be approved soon. They added that the total project cost of Rs 58.240 billion would be financed through Public Sector Development Programme and Annual Development Plan on equal cost sharing basis.

The project comprises construction of 105-kilometer long track including 24.58-kilometer loop-line new single line railway track infrastructure from Thar Coal mines to new Chhor Station and;(ii) construction of 18-kilometer long new double line track (9-Kilometer on each side), includes 4.20-kilometer long loop-lines, from Bin Qasim railway station to Port Qasim.

The construction of seven railway stations along the railway route with 14 platforms are in the scope of the work of the project, and of seven stations, two major stations would be established at Thar coal mines and new Chhor station, respectively. And five intermediate stations would be established between two major stations.

Thar coal mines to Railway line: PM orders completion of project by Mar 23

The electricity infrastructure such as provision of grid power (at major stations), on-site generation set and solar power (at intermediate stations) will be provided to supply power to the equipment at stations. In order to protect the track against flash flooding during the seasonal and extreme rainfall, intermittent culverts will be provided to allow flow of floodwater across the track.

The main objective of this project is to connect Thar Coal mines and Port Qasim with Pakistan Railways (PR) network through New Rail Links and is aligned with the sectoral objectives by providing bulk transportation facilities according to the requirement of the growing economy. The proposed project falls under the category of Infrastructure Development.

The project has been designed to provide reliable and efficient railway infrastructure to break the geographical barriers of Thar coal and enable its transportation across the country and to provide environment friendly mode of coal transportation. If transported through railway, the environmental pollution will be minimal besides reducing traffic congestion on roads.

The project to enable utilization of indigenous Thar coal to bring import bill in line with the pillar of Pakistan Vision 2025 and enable expansion of Thar coal to rationalize fuel cost thus bringing reduction in the cost of production of electricity besides ensuring uplift of local populace of Tharparkar through generation of royalty and job creation.

The coal demand in Pakistan is mainly driven by two major sectors, i.e., Power Sector and Cement industry. The demand of coal will further increase due to upcoming capacity additions in both Power and Cement sector. With successful commercial operation of indigenous coal power plant in Thar coal fields, it is imperative the growing coal demand should be met through Thar coal to displace imported coal. Such initiatives have already been noticed where upcoming coal-based power capacity addition is being designed on Thar coal.

"Design and Technology Institute, National Development Planning Commission 
hold dialogue on national policy for precision quality in Ghana","Design and Technology Institute, National Development Planning Commission 
hold dialogue on national policy for precision quality in Ghana","The Design and Technology Institute (DTI) in collaboration with the National Development Planning Commission (NDPC) has held a multi-stakeholder dialogue to commence the development of a national policy for precision quality training in Ghana.

The organistations believe that with Ghana’s youthful population, the country will obtain great opportunities should it fully harness the human resources.

As such, establishing a National Precision Quality Policy is expected to create thousands of sustainable jobs and work opportunities for young Ghanaian women and men.

The consultative conference which was held under the theme “Unlocking the Skills and Competencies of Young People for Quality Jobs in Ghana and the Globalized Labour Market” brought together key state and non-state stakeholders including the Ghana Standard Authority (GSA), Commission for Technical and Vocational Education and Training (CTVET), Association of Ghana Industries (AGI), academia and Master Craft Persons to provide input into a national policy on precision quality as a key component of the TVET education in Ghana.

The conference also saw stakeholders from the fields of construction, design, the medical sector, digital skills and artificial intelligence and the clothing industry share their views on the role precision quality played in their respective fields and how a national policy would stimulate youth employment in diverse fields.

They made a clear case for public private partnerships to advance training and skills development for young people.

As part of the conference, participants were taken through the findings of a baseline research commissioned by DTI to help gather relevant data on the State of TVET education in Ghana.

Speaking at the event, Chief Executive Officer of DTI, Constance Elizabeth Swaniker commended the Mastercard Foundation for their immense role in the implementation of the PQ programme and other stakeholders for their tremendous support so far for the soon-to-be-developed National Policy on Precision Quality.

She said, “We will continue to engage with all stakeholders in our collective effort to support the national agenda in addressing the skills gap challenge facing academia and industry and provide the basis for the creation of sustainable jobs for the youth through TVET programmes. We look forward to the kind of collaboration fostered through this conference as we shape and create a national policy on PQ Training for Ghana”.

On his part, Director-General of NDPC, Dr Kodjo Mensah-Abrampa stated that skill development constraints identified are the limited number of skilled industrial personnel and the mismatch to industrial needs.

“Our proposals for the medium-term would be to ensure improved skills development for the industry by transforming the apprenticeship training model from a supply-driven approach to a market-demand model. These would help consolidate our gains in skills training and position our youth for the future of work,” he said.

The Minister for Employment and Labour Relations, Ignatius Baffour-Awuah in his address was emphatic that one sure way to facilitate the development agenda of the nation is to have a highly skilled and strongly motivated labour force.

He indicated that the Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the process for nations and organisations to plan and prepare for the future of work, to ensure that they have people with the requisite skills and knowledge to produce world-class goods and services.

“The widespread adoption of precision quality in training and practice of our skilled labour would greatly contribute to value addition of the Ghanaian labour force and raise the quality of local products and services to international standards"", he said.

As part of the programme, several activities have been initiated among key stakeholders to tackle issues of precision quality in service delivery in Ghana.

The conference forms part of a three-year “Transforming youth TVET livelihoods for sustainable jobs’’ partnership between DTI and the Mastercard Foundation, as part of the Foundation’s Young Africa Works strategy in Ghana.

This seeks to provide 40,000 direct and indirect work opportunities for young people in the country.

Meanwhile, the development of a national policy for precision quality launched in Ghana would integrate the CTVET accredited precision quality curriculum into the learning outcomes of senior high schools, technical universities and workshops of Master Craft persons ensuring standardisation across board.

A national policy on precision quality would also ensure that students and apprentices are assessed by experts for certification, after completion of course modules, to provide the basis for hiring and inform salaries and benefits as well as promotions and career progression.

And create a system that empowers the public to demand quality goods and services from artisans and other industry players to drive compliance and quality of service.

P.Q. Properties wins appeal to develop property in Stellarton,P.Q. Properties wins appeal to develop property in Stellarton,"P.Q. Properties Ltd. has successfully won an appeal to put a four-unit development on property located at 25 Bunker Hill in Stellarton.

The Pictou County construction company took their appeal to the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board after Stellarton's town council declined to approve a development agreement on Dec. 14, 2020, which had the same effect as refusing it.

Related stories

The board held a preliminary hearing by telephone conference on March 11 to consider whether the board had jurisdiction to hear the appeal. At the request of both the town and the P.Q. Properties, and because of the unusual facts of the case, the UARB determined it did have jurisdiction.

A notice of public hearing was advertised both on the UARB website, through mailouts and in the newspaper.

According to the planner’s report, the development will be a four-unit dwelling with two units fronting on Bunker Hill and two units fronting on Rutherford Street. There is planned driveway access for all the units.

The property is in a Residential Two Unit zone which allows for multiple unit dwellings.

The UARB ultimately decided Stellarton council’s decision to refuse P.Q. Properties Ltd.’s development agreement application did not reasonably carry out the intent of the town’s Municipal Planning Strategy.

Top 25 Quantum Cryptography & Encryption Companies [2024],Top 25 Quantum Cryptography & Encryption Companies [2024],"Story of the quantum cryptography starts with the lattice, multivariate, hash, code, and supersingular elliptic curve isogeny based cryptography — not to mention the symmetric-key quantum resistance approach — may as well be Klingon to most of us, but they are — and will continue to be — important in the future in protecting us from the various evils out there on the internet.

Quantum Cryptography Overview

Starting from the conjugate coding efforts of Gilles Brassard and Stephen Wiesner in the early 1970s, work by David Deutsch and Artur Ekert brought the science forward. Quantum cryptography just might revolutionize it.

Currently, most of the encryption systems are sufficient in dealing with the threats, but as Industry 4.0 takes hold, and AI, ML and quantum information technologies (QIT) become more advanced, nations, multinational conglomerates, SMEs, NGOs, and individuals will have to watch out.

This is especially pertinent with the rise of quantum computing cryptography (QCC) and the subsequent post quantum era in cryptography that will inevitably follow.

To eliminate — or at the very least, mitigate — this menace, quantum encryption companies have come into being specializing in post quantum cryptography solutions for the pre-quantum client.

Because of this, we have formulated a list of top quantum cryptography companies whose products and solutions concentrate on the dangers that quantum computing can cause to communication and business in the future if the rest of the world doesn’t take heed.

The list includes, though is not limited to, the following startups, more established quantum cryptography companies and even a multinational whose IP intent are shaping this nascent industry toward an exciting trajectory. For those preferring a much deeper dive, I recommend heading over to TQD’s very own data platform, The Quantum Insider (TQI) for all your data needs.

Quantum Cryptography Statistics Don’t Lie

Although this list isn’t exhaustive, we have included all the companies which are active in the industry, they have a functioning website, active social media channels, research done or ongoing, as well as — for some — funding rounds completed (I omitted about a dozen or so either because they’re in stealth mode/have sparse websites/inactive socials and/or dubious claims from little work completed).

From all this information, the reader can gather that the UK and US are tied with five companies apiece, though with a population of 328 million — compared to the UK’s 66 million — the Americans have a huge numerical population advantage. The UK’s impressive per capita number of startups, no doubt, will surely grow with time.

China, on the other hand, only has three representatives on the list and considering it is supposed to be the global leader in quantum cryptography and communications, is a little shocking; however, with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) always ready to do one over on its biggest rival in the space, the US, TQD is sure the moneybags will be open soon enough to create more state-owned enterprises (SOE) or ones at least partly owned by the government in Beijing.

Canada’s two startups, again per capita, just go to prove what an innovative country it is in quantum information science (QIS), and how it is surely going to do much more in the future.

"Manufacturing, safety and quality control of vaccines","Manufacturing, safety and quality control of vaccines","This article is part of a series of explainers on vaccine development and distribution. Learn more about vaccines – from how they work and how they’re made to ensuring safety and equitable access – in WHO’s Vaccines Explained series.



How a vaccine is approved for production



For more information on the three phases of vaccine clinical trials, click here.



Once a vaccine has reached pre-approval stage following clinical trials, it is assessed by the relevant regulatory body for compliance with quality, safety and efficacy criteria. Following regulatory approval, manufacturers can submit a vaccine to WHO for prequalification (PQ), an assessment process that ensures quality, safety and efficacy and helps the UN and other international procurement organizations determine the programmatic suitability of a vaccine.







During global health emergencies, the WHO Emergency Use Listing Procedure (EUL) may be used to allow emergency use of the vaccine. The EUL exists because, in a pandemic situation, products that could benefit the lives of people all over the world may be prevented from coming to market with sufficient speed. The EUL is a fast-tracked but rigorous process, designed to bring impactful products to all those in need, as quickly as possible, on a time-limited basis and based on a risk-versus-benefit evaluation. The WHO PQ/EUL recommendation may be used by UN agencies such as UNICEF and the Pan American Health Organization Revolving Fund for procurement decisions in low- and middle-income countries. Gavi also relies on WHO EUL/PQ to specify which vaccines its funds may be used to purchase.



How it’s made



Typically, companies will work independently to complete clinical development plans for a vaccine. Once a vaccine is authorized, manufacturing begins to scale up. The antigen (part of the germ that our immune system reacts to) is weakened or deactivated. To form the full vaccine, all ingredients are combined.



The whole process, from preclinical trial to manufacture, can sometimes take over a decade to complete. In the search for a COVID-19 vaccine, researchers and developers are working on several different phases in parallel, to speed up results. It is the scale of the financial and political commitments to the development of a vaccine that has allowed this accelerated development to take place. Also, nations and international health organizations are working together through COVAX to invest in development capacity upfront to streamline the process, as well as to ensure equitable distribution of vaccines.



How it’s packaged



Once the vaccine has been made in bulk quantities’, it is bottled in glass vials and then carefully packaged for safe cold storage and transport.



Vaccine packaging must be able to withstand extreme temperatures, as well as the risks involved in being transported globally. Therefore, vaccine vials are most commonly made from glass, as it is durable and able to maintain its integrity in extreme temperatures.

How it’s stored



When a vaccine is too hot or too cold, it becomes less effective or even inactive. If stored at the incorrect temperature, vaccines can be ruined or unsafe for use. Most vaccines require refrigerated storage at between 2 and 8 °C. Some vaccines require temperatures as cold as -20°C. Some of the newer vaccines need to be kept ultra cold at -70°C. For frozen vaccines some of them can be safely stored for a limited time between 2 and 8°C.



Regular refrigerators cannot maintain an even temperature consistently, so specialized medical refrigerators are required for these precious products.



How it’s shipped



To maintain this cold chain, vaccines are shipped using specialized equipment that does not compromise the integrity of the product. Once shipments land in the destination country, refrigerated lorries transport the vaccines from the airport to the warehouse cold room. From there, portable iceboxes are used to transport vaccines from the cold room to regional centres where they’re stored in refrigerators. If vaccination takes place outside of the regional facility, the final step often requires portable iceboxes to transport the goods to local areas for vaccination campaigns. New technologies have invented some portable devices that can keep vaccines at their cold temperature for several days without needing electricity.

Quality control



Once vaccines start being administered, national authorities and WHO constantly monitor for – and establish the severity of – any possible adverse side effects and responses from people who have received the vaccine. The safety of the vaccine is paramount, with regular assessments and post-approval clinical studies to report on its safety and effectiveness.

"Mark Sapperstein’s ’28 Walker’ Planning 112-Townhome Development in Locust 
Point","Mark Sapperstein’s ’28 Walker’ Planning 112-Townhome Development in Locust 
Point","Mark Sapperstein and his development company 28 Walker has the PQ Corporation plant at 1301 E. Fort Ave. in Locust Point under contract and is planning a townhome development that will add approximately 112 homes. PQ, a company based in Valley Forge, PA, closed the plant in January.

28 Walker needs the industrial zoning at the five-acre site changed to R8 in order to move the project forward. Sapperstein has been meeting with the board of the Locust Point Civic Association (LPCA) and met with the general membership last night. A motion was made at last night’s meeting to have a special meeting on this topic on March 25th at 730pm at the McHenry Row Conference Center.

“There wasn’t enough time to learn about it, discuss, and take a vote,” said LPCA President Matt Farcosky. “Mark (Sapperstein) has been open the entire time to all discussion and has been really solution-oriented.”

LPCA is familiar with Sapperstein as 28 Walker developed several phases of the 20-acre McHenry Row project and was involved in the development of Silo Point and the surrounding townhomes. Farcosky praised Sapperstein for adding traffic guards to McHenry Row at rush hour as many Locust Point residents would cut through McHenry Row to get back home.

Farcosky said some of the issues brought up for the new townhome development involved traffic patterns and green spaces. He noted LPCA has been asking the Baltimore City Department of Transportation (DOT) for a parking study for two years as traffic has increased with all the new development, but LPCA has not made any progress. Sapperstein has said he will fund a traffic study for the neighborhood.

Sapperstein was interested in building a pool at Latrobe Park for the Locust Point community, but with LPCA deciding the logistics of that wouldn’t work, he is looking to improve the ball fields adjacent to the development site which are part of Francis Scott Key Elementary Middle School and Latrobe Park. Sapperstein has experience in a project like this as he partnered with South Baltimore Little League to improve its fields adjacent to McHenry Row.

Sapperstein is also planning new head-in parking spaces for the Locust Point Community on the existing Decatur St. and an extension of Decatur St. that would more than double the existing parking spaces. The improvements to Latrobe Park also could include a new 50-space parking lot.

A redevelopment of the PQ Corporation site will involve an environmental cleanup that 28 Walker will partner on with PQ Corporation. A rail spur will be removed from the site as well.

Sapperstein is hoping to begin work on the site at the end of the year. 28 Walker will install all the site infrastructure and a national home builder will construct and sell the homes in phases.

The homes will be 35 ft. tall and will be three- to four-bedroom homes with two-car garages and rooftop decks. Sapperstein said there will be great landscaping throughout the new community.

The homes will be on two blocks facing Decatur St. and a new north/south street that will connect with Fort Ave. New alleys will be constructed to access the garages.

The PQ Corporation site is adjacent to McHenry Row, which has apartment buildings, office buildings, and retail, but is separated by CSX tracks at a lower grade.

Sapperstein said he decided on townhomes for the new project because it would be “the least impactful development.” He said the site would make sense for a distribution facility with its access to highways and rail infrastructure and that a new apartment building would “certainly lease up,” but he is trying to do something “more soft” with the least impact on traffic. He noted this was especially important as the site shares Decatur St. with Francis Scott Key Elementary Middle School.

This will be the largest townhome development on the South Baltimore Peninsula since Sapperstein partnered with Pulte Homes on the 121-towhome McHenry Pointe project in 2006.

HDR (High Dynamic Range) Explained,HDR (High Dynamic Range) Explained,"My experience covering home video extends back to the early days of DVD. But of all the new technologies and formats I've covered in that time, none has generated as much confusion as high dynamic range (HDR). In this article, I will attempt to demystify the subject of HDR, a technology that I find to be the most significant development to hit home video in years.

Lifelike Defined

Dynamic range in audio or video describes the difference between the lowest and the highest levels of information available in a signal. So, to describe something as having “high dynamic range” is to state that it offers a wider dynamic range than was previously available. What are the implications for the viewing experience? In simplest terms, it means there is an increase in the number of brightness levels the display is capable of reproducing. This results in a more “true to life” image: no more muted headlights on dark highways, or dim stars against the black of space. But it doesn't stop there.

While HDR photography is well established, HDR video is relatively new. Much of it results from work done by Dolby Laboratories, which first launched HDR in theaters with Dolby Cinema and later brought it to Ultra HD Blu-ray and streaming via Dolby Vision. The most common HDR format is HDR10, a bare-bones version derived from the work the company did with Dolby Vision that was provided to the industry royalty-free. Additional HDR formats include Hybrid Log Gamma (HLG), Technicolor's Advanced HDR, and HDR10+, but all of these are either in early development or have limited available content. I'll touch on them more in a bit.

Light, Bright: SDR vs. HDR

What does HDR bring to the table? HDR's key benefits include an ability to render much brighter highlights, deliver vastly increased color volume (both saturation and brightness), and boost video fidelity through higher bit depths. The standard dynamic range (SDR) provided by the high-definition format—the one we are used to watching—is mastered with a peak video brightness level of 100 nits. HDR, in contrast, can reach up to 10,000 nits! An early bit of misinformation surrounding the format was that HDR's added brightness would create eyestrain, but that isn't how it works. Much of the brightness range in the video image remains in the same range as it does with SDR, but HDR provides additional headroom for brightness “peaks” (streetlights, or the sparkle of sun reflected off chrome, for example). It's these peaks, also called specular highlights, that give images a natural look that more closely matches what we see in the world around us every day. While new digital cameras used for cinematography are responsible for much of HDR's impact, older film-based content also contains sufficiently high dynamic range to allow for mastering in the format.

A Wider World of Color

Color is the next key component of HDR. The Ultra HDTV format uses a color gamut called BT.2020 that's notably wider than the Rec. 709 one used for standard HDTV. However, the added brightness provided by HDR extends the volume of color as well. While color in the A/V world is traditionally represented in two-dimensional space with data points for saturation and hue, it also extends out in the vertical direction with luminance. It's the increased luminance, or light output, HDR provides that delivers a wider color range.

Figure 2: HDR vs. SDR color volume. Credit: Dolby Laboratories

Another HDR component is higher video bit depth. HD/SDR video content was limited to 8-bit resolution, with video from black to white (100 nits) divided up into 256 levels. But the HDR10 format uses 10-bit resolution, which increases the range to 1024 levels. The main benefit here is the elimination of banding artifacts (typically seen in the blue gradients of skylines, or in dark scenes with subtle tonal variations). The use of 10-bit encoding allows for more precise rendering of near-black tones, which create a particular challenge during the video mastering process.

Beyond Gamma

While the benefits of HDR are substantial, it doesn't come without caveats. First off, HDR doesn't employ the traditional gamma system used by HDTV and the earlier NTSC video format, which takes into account the display's peak brightness and lowest black level capability and then adjusts the values in between to create a desired balance. HDR instead uses an absolute system called Perceptual Quantizer (PQ) where each video level is mapped one-to-one with the display. PQ makes the bold assumption that the display will provide enough range at both the high and low ends to map content directly, meaning that it should be able to reproduce the same peak brightness and black level the content was mastered at. Unfortunately, that isn't always the case, and the display needs to determine how to handle content that goes beyond its capabilities using a process called “tone mapping.” With tone mapping, any extra brightness gets, to put it bluntly, crammed into a smaller amount of space at the upper limit of the display's range. The same thing also happens at the low end as near-black tones get mapped to the display's measured black point. While the Dolby Vision system has its own tone mapping standards, HDR10 does not, so each display manufacturer is left to their own devices to handle HDR10 tone mapping—something they do with varying degrees of success. Ideally, a display would handle tone mapping consistently for all content, but that's not the case yet. What we are starting to see is solutions that help to mitigate the problem, such as the built-in tone mapping feature of the Panasonic DP-UB-820 Ultra HD Blu-ray player that I reviewed in Sound & Vision's October/November 2018 issue.

BT.2020 vs. P3 Color

Another confusing issue with HDR is the BT.2020 color space that it's associated with. No current consumer video displays can provide full coverage of BT.2020, a color space that was designed to allow headroom for future technology developments. Movies are largely mastered in the P3 format, which is wider than the REC. 709 one used for HDTV, but not as wide as BT.2020. However, P3 is not a consumer format, and it's incompatible with the color matrix used for consumer video. So, while it's common to see color in HDR content referred to as P3, the reality is that all HDR content is mastered using the BT.2020 color profile, which contains its own P3 color coordinates. (If you were to calibrate a consumer display directly for P3 and then use it to display HDR content, there would be significant color issues since the color coordinates are completely different.) While HDR always uses BT.2020 color, the content can range from black-and-white to images with saturation levels that barely exceed REC. 709, P3, or any color space within the gamut envelope of BT.2020. To put it another way, just because a car can do 200 mph (BT.2020) doesn't mean it will go that fast; we are limited to 65 mph (P3) because that is what the road infrastructure currently supports.

Figure 4: BT.2020 (UHDTV/HDR) vs. Rec. 709 (HD/SDR) color gamut.

HDR Flavors

Now that I've summarized what HDR is, let's discuss the various formats mentioned above in more detail. HDR10 uses static metadata to communicate information about the content being fed to the display. This includes the specs of the display monitor originally used to master the content (black level, peak brightness level, and color gamut) as well as the content itself (the highest value for any single red, green or blue sub-pixel, along with average pixel level). While this data does provide a snapshot of the content, it only represents the extremes. Dolby Vision, in contrast, supplies per-frame metadata. This helps enormously with flat-panel TVs since information is available for each video frame to guide the display's dynamic contrast processing. (The same information would go far to improve performance with lower light-output systems like projectors, which require much more aggressive tone mapping than flat-panel TVs require, but consumer 4K projectors are currently limited to HDR10 support.) Dolby Vision also uses color metadata that provides 12-bit precision to eliminate color banding, although this typically gets processed at 10 bits since most displays are not 12-bit-capable.

HLG uses a variation of gamma similar to what's seen in more traditional video playback systems. It permits greater flexibility to accommodate a range of production environments and display capabilities, which is why HLG is being employed by TV broadcasters. DirectTV and Dish are also using HLG to provide HDR for certain sports events being transmitted in Ultra HD.

HDR10+ is a format introduced by Samsung that, similar to Dolby Vision, delivers frame-by-frame metadata and should provide benefits with the company's TVs that use dynamic processing to increase contrast performance. So far, HDR10+ has appeared on a handful of Blu-rays and has also been implemented by Amazon for its streaming content.

HDMI and HDR

The final thing to consider with HDR is our old friend (or enemy), HDMI. You'll need gear with HDMI version 2.0a connections to pass Ultra HD video with static HDR10 metadata. Be careful when selecting HDMI cables though, since not all provide the 18Gbps bandwidth needed to pass full 4K/60p signals. Look for cables that actually carry the certification symbol to ensure sufficient bandwidth for your required cable length. You'd be surprised how many cables (including ultra-expensive boutique versions) don't provide the bandwidth needed to pass signals properly.

Conclusion

Many sources—Ultra HD Blu-ray, Amazon Video, iTunes, Vudu, YouTube, satellite, and more— now support HDR, and the range of compatible hardware and content will only continue to grow. It's an exciting time for video as more displays hit the market with performance levels we've only dreamed about, and also at incredible prices given the advanced technology that's onboard. If you haven't yet experienced HDR, I highly recommend doing so to see what the future of video is all about.",https://www.soundandvision.com/content/hdr-explained,"My experience covering home video extends back to the early days of DVD.

"PQ Bypass Announces $60 Million Financing to Advance New Therapeutic 
Approach to Peripheral Arterial Disease","PQ Bypass Announces $60 Million Financing to Advance New Therapeutic 
Approach to Peripheral Arterial Disease","SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--PQ Bypass, Inc., a medical device company dedicated to advancing treatment options for patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD), has entered into an agreement that provides for up to an aggregate of $60 million in equity financing, led by Deerfield Management. Joining the round are existing investors, including Seroba Life Sciences and MedTech Venture Partners. The financing round also allowed the company to convert approximately $15 million in outstanding convertible debt and interest to equity. Funds will be used to advance the clinical development of the company’s technology for the treatment of long blockages in leg arteries caused by PAD.

“With this funding we continue our pursuit of the science that will bring us closer to commercial release of this important advancement in the care of patients with PAD,” said Richard Ferrari, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PQ Bypass. “We are very fortunate to have Deerfield as an anchor investor and, together, we are working to develop a minimally-invasive treatment alternative for a disease that affects millions of people, worldwide.”

In people with PAD, leg arteries can become blocked by long segments of plaque that restrict blood flow to the lower leg and foot. This can lead to pain, loss of mobility and even amputation. Extremely long blockages, such as those greater than 20 centimeters, are quite challenging to treat. Historically, physicians have performed open bypass surgery, which has the benefit of durability; however, it is associated with an increased risk of complications, lengthy hospital stays and prolonged rehabilitation. Minimally invasive approaches, including angioplasty and stenting, work very well on shorter blockages; however, they have not been as effective on longer ones, often resulting in repeat procedures within one year.

Percutaneous femoropopliteal bypass (the DETOUR procedure) is designed to provide the durability of open bypass with the benefits of a minimally-invasive approach. In this procedure, PQ Bypass’ proprietary stent graft technology is placed from the superficial femoral artery, into the femoral vein, and back into the popliteal artery to create a detour around the blockage. The stent graft bypass re-directs oxygen-rich blood, with the goal of restoring blood flow to the lower leg and foot of the patient.

“PQ Bypass has developed a novel technology and procedure to address a true clinical conundrum in the treatment of long lesions from PAD. This technology has the potential to be the standard of care for the segment of PAD patients who, today, have to choose between either an open surgical treatment that lasts longer or less-invasive treatment options that potentially fail approximately 50% of the time. In addition to improving outcomes for patients, this has the potential to significantly reduce the cost burden of long lesion PAD,” said Andrew ElBardissi, M.D., of Deerfield.

About Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD)

Peripheral Artery Disease, or PAD, is a common but serious circulatory condition wherein adequate blood flow does not reach the limbs due to a build-up of fatty deposits and calcium on the artery walls. If severe enough, blocked blood flow can cause tissue death and can sometimes lead to amputation of the foot or leg.

Lower extremity PAD is the third leading cause of atherosclerotic cardiovascular morbidity, following coronary artery disease and stroke. Systematic reviews indicate that PAD affects over 200 million people worldwide—and the prevalence of PAD is increasing as “baby boomers” enter high-risk age groups. With estimates of more than 20% of the population projected to age into the 65-and-over cohort by the year 2050, PAD is a growing epidemic with staggering social and economic costs.

About the DETOUR II Trial

The DETOUR II trial is the first and only pivotal investigational trial in the United States for percutaneous bypass. Currently underway, the trial will enroll up to 292 patients at up to 40 sites across the United States and Europe, and is led by national co-Principal Investigators Sean Lyden, MD, FACS and Chairman of the Department of Vascular Surgery at the Cleveland Clinic, and Jihad Mustapha, MD, FACC, FSCAI, CEO at Advanced Cardiac and Vascular Amputation Prevention Centers.

"A qualitative assessment of the challenges of WHO prequalification for 
anti-malarial drugs in China","A qualitative assessment of the challenges of WHO prequalification for 
anti-malarial drugs in China","Although WHO PQ has provided access for anti-malarial drugs to enter the global market, few Chinese pharmaceutical companies have achieved WHO PQ for anti-malarial drugs. This study used qualitative methods to understand the underlying reason behind this situation, with the intent to offer suggestions on how to accelerate progress not only for anti-malarial drugs, but potentially for other Chinese medical products to enter into global public sector market.

This study included all of the KIs that were identified as involved with R&D of anti-malarial drugs in central government agencies, pharmaceutical companies, as well as universities and research institutes. According to the interviews, most respondents recognized that the lack of WHO PQ has become a huge barrier for Chinese anti-malarial products to enter global public sector market. According to previous research, the total export value of artemisinin-derived FPPs has been increasing and has roughly equaled that of artemisinin-derived APIs from 2012 to 2014 [9]. This indicates that China is moving away from exporting raw APIs to FPPs, which are more technologically advanced and profitable. However, without WHO PQ certification, most of Chinese anti-malarial drugs are destined for the private retail market in Africa or sold through intermediaries that are exporting FPPs to a third country. Entering the African market through a third country reduces the profit for Chinese pharmaceutical manufacturers, likely limits the affordability of Chinese anti-malarial drugs in Africa, and potentially stunts R&D of Chinese medical products. Anti-malarial drugs are mostly provided through the African public sector market. Since WHO PQ is the fundamental prerequisite for most international public sector purchasers and for entering the public sector market, WHO PQ could expand the global production of Chinese anti-malarial drugs.

While the merits of achieving WHO PQ are well accepted in China, existing barriers, such as high upfront costs, unpredictable benefit, as well as limited information and technical support have slowed application for WHO PQ. Every country has its own standard for pharmaceutical production. Due to the differences between Chinese GMP, GCP, GLP and WHO requirements, few enterprises could likely pass WHO PQ without high upfront costs, such as purchase of new equipment or even building a new factory. This may be the main reason why few Chinese pharmaceutical companies start the WHO PQ process, especially when investment may not lead to predictable sales and profits.

This study indicated that some incentives might accelerate the WHO PQ progress in China, including supportive policies related to tax and the drug approval process. Since WHO PQ requires a drug production license of the local country, the slow process in China of applying for national license sometimes stops pharmaceutical factories from applying for WHO PQ. Many other countries have used similar incentives to accelerate R&D for certain medical products, such as the ‘Fast Track’ or ‘Accelerated Approval’. Also, tax relief could be a great incentive for pharmaceutical companies. This means that if a pharmaceutical company has been involved in anti-malarial production, it could have a percentage of tax relief. Such accelerating processes could be incentives for pharmaceutical companies to focus on products that mainly affect developing countries. However, government support is the foundation for making these incentives possible.

In order to facilitate the development of WHO PQ in China, more incentive policies and financial support from government should be provided. Initial funds for R&D could be provided by the Chinese Government. A successful example of collaborating with government in China is the WHO PQ-intravenous artesunate achieved by Guilin Pharmaceutical, a process that involved technical assistance from the non-profit organization Medicines for Malaria Venture. It shows that when government provides a favourable environment and necessary services for enterprise development, it is possible to take industry to the next level [13].

In addition to supporting the development of equipment and standard production process in pharmaceutical factories, human resource training related to WHO PQ is needed. To be specific, training administrators from Chinese pharmaceutical companies to understand the requirements and assessment process of WHO PQ will help them be well prepared to meet the requirements. WHO conducted multiple training on WHO PQ of medicines and vaccines in China between 2006 and 2010, and offered targeted training and consultation services to help over 400 pharmaceutical companies apply for WHO PQ between 2010 and 2012, with financial support from GF and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation [14]. WHO conducted PQ training workshops in 2013 and 2014 during the China Pharma Holdings Inc (CPhi) exhibition, and attended the CPhi exhibition to answer questions regarding FPP and API prequalification procedures in 2016 and 2017. With the consultation and human resource training provided by Medicines for Malaria Venture, Guilin Pharmaceutical became the first WHO PQ pharmaceutical company worldwide to produce intravenous artesunate in 2011 [13]. According to the KIs, training content might need to be more specific, such as targeting deficiencies in Chinese pharmaceutical companies, apart from a general introduction to PQ process and standard.

Governments could also facilitate progress by bilateral or multilateral collaboration and negotiation with African countries and international organizations. India is a good example, illustrating the importance of government participation. The collaboration established between the national regulatory agencies of India and the user country and WHO has facilitated prequalification of medical products by WHO in India [15]. The Indian Government has been collaborating with WHO to strengthen pharmaceuticals in India through the provision of technical support for the development of a Comprehensive Institutional Development Plan [16]. India has 12 major manufacturing facilities producing vaccines that are sold in the national and international market in 150 countries, making India a major global vaccine supplier. Nearly one-third of the prequalified vaccines, and over two-thirds of the medicines purchased through international organizations were produced in India [4]. Moreover, although India is one of the major importers of China’s anti-malarial drugs, it might be also a strong competitor for Chinese anti-malarial markets in Africa. At May 2017, 17 types of WHO-PQ reviewed medicines/FPPs are manufactured in China, including 11 types of anti-malarials, while 368 types of WHO-PQ reviewed medicine/FPPs are manufactured in India, including 21 types of anti-malarial drugs. Due to the high percentage of PQ products from India, Indian medical products have become a major brand in African countries, bringing the companies profit and the country a better international reputation.

The Chinese Government has prioritized supporting African local production of medicines, and has donated many medical products to African countries. Many Chinese pharmaceutical companies have gained certification from a certain country or a region to sale their medical products. However, while these methods could bring Chinese drugs to other countries and might seem to be a bypass for WHO PQ, in the long run, they may benefit only a few countries or regions. As mentioned by the KIs, if the Chinese Government could help Chinese anti-malarial drugs to be included in the procurement list of international buyers through multilateral or bilateral negotiation, and in some way guarantee the potential market for Chinese anti-malarial drugs, it could be an incentive for pharmaceutical companies to start the PQ process.

Strengthening collaboration with sub-Saharan African countries, and others, could be a mechanism for developing the WHO PQ process in China, such as the public–private partnership (PPP) of Chinese enterprises collaborating with scientific institutions and non-governmental organizations to obtain WHO PQ for the live-attenuated Japanese encephalitis vaccine in 2013 [17]. PPPs can share the risk and develop innovative, long-term relationships between public and private sectors [18]. However, PPPs have been somewhat controversial, in that private investors may seek to acquire a higher rate of return than the Chinese Government’s bond rate, while much of the income risk associated with a project may be borne by the public sector [19]. Contract management is a vital factor in the success of PPP collaboration.

While this study interviewed KIs from multiple representative backgrounds, it has some limitations. First, since the study was designed to understand the underlying reason for limited PQ application in China, only Chinese KIs relevant to anti-malarial R&D and WHO PQ were included. KIs from WHO or donor institutions who might have provided useful suggestions from different perspectives were not included. Second, since the KIs were located in various geographical locations, it was not possible to use focus group discussions for this study. However, conducting the KI interviews in their workplaces allowed for considerable insight into the perceived barriers and their suggestions.",https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-018-2303-8,"While China is a major manufacturer of artemisinin and its derivatives, it

Top 100 projects in the Middle East and North Africa,Top 100 projects in the Middle East and North Africa,"Regional developments scale up as post-oil planning takes root in earnest across the region

While the Middle East and North Africa (Mena) projects market has long been dominated by the sort of ambitious schemes that are only brought about by both serious capital and resolute political will, 2017 saw a seismic shift in the scale and scope of projects being envisioned.

Scroll down for a list of the region's top 100 projects

The debut of the $500bn Neom masterplan in late October represents something of a paradigm shift for the region. If successful, the vast undertaking will become the new benchmark.

With backing from the government and the Public Investment Fund (PIF), this flagship development of the ascendant Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman al-Saud is set to envelop 26,500 square kilometres of land along 468km of coastline along the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aqaba. It will also cross into Jordan and Egypt connect Saudi Arabia and Egypt with a causeway across the Red Sea.

By 2030, Neom’s contribution to the kingdom’s economy is expected to be at least $100bn. If these projections are correct, and the scheme is successful, this would make it a significant contributor to the country’s post-oil future.

Neom’s first tangible development is the appointment of the UK’s Buro Happold as the programme manager. The construction of its first phase is scheduled to be completed by 2025.

Egyptian ambition

Another demonstration of the dynamism of the region’s projects landscape was a last-minute spike in the value of contract awards in December 2017, brought about by a deal between Egypt and Russia for the construction of the $21bn El-Dabaa plant, Egypt’s first nuclear energy project. The project is part of a wider atomic vogue sweeping the Middle East – with the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Jordan all now advancing along the path towards the roll-out of nuclear power.

The award of the El-Dabaa facility more than doubled the value of Egypt’s 2017 contract awards to $38.5bn, placing it just behind the UAE, at $46.8bn, and far ahead of Saudi Arabia, at $25.2bn.

Neither is this Egypt’s only project of note. On the contrary, President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi is proving himself to be a megaproject enthusiast. Egypt has its own mixed-use urban megaproject, The Capital Cairo, with a development cost of $45bn, and is expected to issue the first contracts for the Golden Triangle, a $29bn mineral resources masterplan, in 2018.

UAE projects

In the UAE, the $55bn Mohammed bin Rashid (MBR) City being developed by the local Emaar Properties and Dubai Holding includes at least one sub-project that merits the title of megaproject in its own right: the $17.7bn Dubai Creek Harbour (DCH), which covers 6 square kilometres in the Ras al-Khor area.

The largest element of the overarching MBR masterplan, DCH is being managed by US-based Hill International, and includes plans for the world’s tallest man-made structure: the Santiago Calatrava-designed Tower at Dubai Creek Harbour.

The masterplan’s retail district is meanwhile tipped to become the world’s largest shopping mall, with a total built-up area of about 3 million square metres, including 1.7 million sq m of retail. Emaar’s Dubai Mall, by contrast, has a total area of 1.1 million sq m.

The $5bn main contract is currently out to tender. The contract award was originally scheduled for September 2018, but Emaar extended the bid submission deadline from 17 December 2017 to 26 April 2018, which could postpone the award.

Other massive mixed-use projects include the $55bn Dubai South development, which encompasses the development of Al-Maktoum International airport by Dubai Aviation Engineering Projects, as well as the masterplans for the $40bn Capital District, the $37bn Yas Island, the $37bn Al-Reem island and the $27bn Saadiyat Island in Abu Dhabi.

[caption id=""attachment_290506"" align=""alignnone"" width=""165""] Total Mena contract awards[/caption]

A range of special economic zones also pepper the roster of the region’s top projects, including four schemes valued at $30bn: Oman’s Special Economic Zone at Duqm (SEZAD), Iran’s Chabahar Port development, and Saudi Arabia’s Jizan City and Jeddah Economic City.

Jeddah also lays claim to two important strategic transport infrastructure schemes that make the upper echelons of the list: the $30.4bn public transportation programme, which includes the Jeddah Metro, alongside a bus, tram and water taxi network; and the $28bn King Abdulaziz International airport.

While Saudi Arabia’s $4.8bn Red Sea tourism project does not make the Top 100 megaprojects list in terms of spending, it represents a significant strategic development for the kingdom that could well yield significant indirect economic benefits by driving the kingdom’s tourism sector forward.

Further afield, the estimated $66bn renewable energy scheme by Algeria’s state-owned Sonelgaz looks set for its next phase after the EU agreed to fund the project in March 2017.

There is significantly more doubt as to whether phase 13 of the $91bn South Pars gas field development will move ahead, as US President Donald Trump’s decision not to ratify the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action raises the spectre of renewed sanctions.

The story across the region, however, is one of renewed vigour in the projects pipeline, bold visions, and the determination to push through ambitious infrastructure schemes in spite of adverse conditions.",https://www.meed.com/middle-east-north-africa-projects/,"While the Middle East and North Africa (Mena) projects market has long been

Prequalification of medicines by WHO,Prequalification of medicines by WHO,"WHO prequalification of medicines is a service provided by WHO to assess the quality, safety and efficacy of medicinal products. Originally, in 2001, the focus was on medicines for treating HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. In 2006, this was extended to cover medicines and products for reproductive health and again in 2008, to cover prequalification of zinc, for managing acute diarrhoea in children. At the end of 2012, the WHO List of Prequalified Medicinal Products contained 316 medicines for priority diseases.

Every year, billions of US dollars worth of medicines are purchased by international procurement agencies for distribution in resource-limited countries. Prequalification is intended to give these agencies the choice of a wide range of quality medicines for bulk purchase.

The WHO prequalification of medicines process: how does it work?

Prequalification consists of five components.

1. Invitation

The WHO Prequalification of Medicines Programme (PQP), other UN agencies (UNAIDS and UNICEF) and UNITAID, issue an invitation to manufacturers to submit an expression of interest (EOI) for product evaluation. Only products included in an EOI are eligible for prequalification.

The inclusion of a medicine in an EOI is based on one or more of three criteria:

it is listed on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines;

an application for its addition to the Model List has been submitted to the relevant WHO Expert Committee for assessment, and is likely to meet the criteria for inclusion (based on public health need, comparative effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness);

it is recommended for use by a current WHO treatment guideline.

2. Dossier submission

The manufacturer provides a comprehensive set of data about the quality, safety and efficacy of the product submitted for evaluation. This includes:

data on the purity of all ingredients used in manufacture;

data on the finished pharmaceutical product (such as information about stability);

results of bioequivalence tests (clinical trials conducted in healthy volunteers), unless waived.

3. Assessment

A team of assessors evaluates all the data presented. Assessment teams include WHO staff and experts from national regulatory authorities worldwide.

4. Inspection

A team of inspectors verifies that the manufacturing sites for the finished pharmaceutical product and its active pharmaceutical ingredient(s) comply with WHO good manufacturing practice. They also verify that any contract research organization that conducted any clinical studies relating to the submitted product complies with WHO good clinical practice and WHO good laboratory practice.

5. Decision

If the product is found to meet the specified requirements, and the associated manufacturing site(s) and contract research organization(s) are compliant with WHO standards, the product is added to the WHO list of prequalified medicinal products.

The WHO prequalification of medicines process can take as little as three months, provided the data presented are complete and demonstrate that the product meets all required standards. If data are insufficient, however, the process can take considerably longer since the manufacturer must submit the necessary data for reassessment.

To ensure that prequalified products continue to meet WHO specifications, PQP regularly re-inspects manufacturing sites of prequalified products. It also evaluates any changes (known as ""variations"") made to specifications, manufacturing processes and quality control of prequalified products, and conducts random quality control tests on sampled prequalified products.

Increasing the availability of quality-assured medicines

PQP bases its activities on international pharmaceutical standards for medicines quality, safety and efficacy. As well as prequalifying medicines, it also prequalifies pharmaceutical quality control laboratories and active pharmaceutical ingredients, and conducts considerable advocacy for medicines of guaranteed quality. Its long-term goal is to increase the availability of quality-assured medicines by assisting manufacturers to comply with WHO standards and supporting regulatory authorities to implement them. It does not seek to replace national regulatory authorities or national authorization systems for importation of medicines.

Capacity building and technical assistance

In addition to evaluation and inspection activities, PQP builds national capacity for sustainable manufacturing and monitoring of quality medicines, by organizing training and hands-on experience at the country-level.

It also offers a three-month rotational post at WHO headquarters to national regulatory staff from developing countries. By working closely with senior Programme assessors, incumbents increase their technical expertise and enhance information exchange between their regulatory authority and PQP on their return to their home country. Each of these activities promotes communication between stakeholders on pharmaceutical issues relating to quality.

Additionally, PQP provides targeted technical assistance for manufacturers and quality control laboratories. Assistance is delivered by specialists who are not involved in WHO prequalification assessment or inspection activities, but who can conduct audits and training at country-level. This assistance is aimed at resolving specific technical problems.

Why does WHO run the Prequalification of Medicines Programme?

PQP is a United Nations programme managed by WHO. It is the only global medicines quality assurance programme. No other global body receives the active support of regulatory experts from both developed and developing countries.
