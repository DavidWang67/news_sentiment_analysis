Banks seek clarification on RBI's credit card network choice guidelines,Banks seek clarification on RBI's credit card network choice guidelines,"Several banks have sought clarity from the Reserve Bank of India regarding the implementation of guidelines issued on March 6, which mandate offering customers the option to choose from multiple card networks for credit cards, according to a report by The Economic Times (ET).

The Reserve Bank of India's directive requires banks and non-banking financial companies to provide this choice both at the time of issuance and renewal. This directive will take effect from September 6, 2024. Click here to connect with us on WhatsApp

One suggestion is that the guidelines should apply prospectively, meaning new credit card customers would choose their preferred network while existing customers would continue with their current network until renewal.

Banks, however, are also concerned that implementing these guidelines during renewals could disrupt business operations. Existing cardholders have been provided offers based on customer profiles, co-branding arrangements, and specific pricing benefits.

These guidelines require card issuers to provide this choice both during the initial issuance and at the time of renewals. However, banks are unsure whether this option needs to be extended to all existing customers or only at renewal time.

What were the Reserve Bank of India's directives on credit card networks?

The guidelines were introduced to ensure customer choice and prevent exclusive agreements between card issuers and networks, as the Reserve Bank observed that some existing arrangements were not conducive to customer choice and directed card issuers to avoid them.

As per the new guidelines, card issuers and networks will be prohibited from entering into any agreement that restricts customers from using other card networks.



Card issuers must provide an option to their eligible customers to choose from multiple card networks, such as Diners Club International, MasterCard, NPCI-Rupay, and Visa, at the time of issuance. For existing cardholders, this choice may be provided during the renewal process.

The guidelines apply to card issuers with more than 1 million active credit cards. Major issuers like HDFC Bank, SBI Card, ICICI Bank, and Axis Bank fall under this category. The norms exclude issuers like American Express, which operate on their own authorised networks.

The Reserve Bank of India circular, however, did not clarify whether the norms would apply to co-branded cards, which are often offered on a single platform.

Indian Banks' Association to discuss the matter

The Indian Banks' Association will discuss the issue to develop a unified approach, ET said. Long-term contracts with co-brand partners and the impact on fees and other facilities for credit card holders are complicating factors that need to be considered.

The total number of credit cards issued by banks in India surpassed 100 million in February 2024, with a significant addition of 1.1 million cards from the previous month.",https://www.business-standard.com/finance/news/banks-seek-clarification-on-rbi-s-credit-card-network-choice-guidelines-124062600176_1.html,"The Reserve Bank of India's directive, which will go into effect in

From the very beginning backward integration has been Reliance Industries ' success mantra. Reliance started out as a polyester business. Its first backward integration that helped it grow phenomenally was into petrochemicals which formed the raw material for polyester. From polyester to petrochemicals to refining to oil and gas exploration, Reliance kept stepping back to step ahead. Its green energy play is also mounted on a considerable captive demand.A crucial factor behind Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani 's success in consumer-facing business is backward integration. When Ambani launched Jio with dirt-cheap data, he also got his own smart and feature phones manufactured. Ditto with retail and e-commerce. Ambani has been on a brand-buying frenzy for the past few years, buying dozens of brands from Hamleys to Zivame to Campa Cola.Ambani has played on integration and adjacencies. Its strength in the telecom market boosted its e-commerce business while its growing e-commerce and retail business powered its FMCG play through backward integration by buying brands and building its own. Its recent foray into consumer electronics and home appliances will be bolstered by its already huge retail and e-commerce network.Now when consumers are spending their money on a range of Reliance products and services from mobile data to TV entertainment to apparels to FMCG to home appliances, Ambani also aims to profit from that spending and buying. His latest fintech business under Jio Financial Servics Ltd (JFSL) aims to ride on extensive consumer network as well the data Reliance has acquired. The tracks that consumers leave while shopping and using Reliance products and services will form a strong databank for JFSL . It was carved out of Reliance Industries last year and made its stock market debut in July 2023 as part of the demerger.JFSL has just launched a new app named Jio Finance . The app is currently in a beta testing stage and will be fine-tuned after user feedback.The aapp will offer UPI payments, bill payments, insurance advisory and digital banking. Eventually JFSL will offer credit products like loans against mutual funds, home loans and others to its customers through the app. In its bid to become the full stack finserv player, Jio Finance will also offer savings accounts services and it will leverage Jio payments bank for the same.""Our end goal is to simplify everything related to finance in a single platform for any user across all demographics, with a comprehensive suite of offerings like lending, investment, insurance, payments and transactions and make financial services more transparent, affordable and intuitive,"" Reliance said. Eventually, it might also add to this app the asset management business its starting jointly with Blackrock Ambani's entry into fintech is based on the huge growth in Indian financial landscape in the coming decade. JFSL is counting on 450 million working population with favorable demographics and India being the 12th largest country by HNI population to drive digital financial services adoption. Financialization of savings, rising affluence and entrepreneurship, and increasing user activity across the entire funnel of smartphone-led, online usage of commerce and services give hope to JFSL. It thinks higher consumption and digitalization will fuel the growth in financial services industry. It plans to focus on consumers, merchants and MSMEs to provide customized products diversified across lending, protection, investments and transactions.JFSL's key growth differentiator will be technology and the biggest weapon the huge data spewed by its retail and telecom business daily. It will adopt a direct-to-consumer approach to leverage its ecosystem to drive low cost of acquisition.It will enable its base technology with AI, alternate data and bolt-on features. JFSL will use its power to leverage alternate data to facilitate non-linear growth. With AI and analytics, it will create enriched customer profiles for tailored offerings. It also hopes to capitalize on new entrant advantage. It sees absence of legacy systems resulting in significant cost efficiencies and enhanced computing capabilities.JFSL will rely on inherent strengths of Reliance: a strong capital base to fund growth strategy and meet regulatory requirements; highly experienced board and management ensuring highest standards of corporate governance; well-established brand presence that drives trust and recognition; and extensive network facilitating easy customer access.With his fintech super app, Ambani enters a crowded and competitive field. If the likes of Amazon Pay, PhonePe and Paytm tried to go the super app way in the first fintech wave, traditional financial services are taking a stab at it now. Businesses like Aditya Birla Capital Angel One and Muthoot Fincorp are building one-stop applications for all sets of financial services, ET has reported. The traditional financial services companies are carrying out this diversification through acquiring and partnering with fintech companies, or by creating their own platforms.JFSL super app will be competing with biggies such as Google, Amazon and Flipkart who are already in the payments business, besides Paytm who got hammered by the regulator for negligences for which Paytm Payments Bank Ltd was told to stop its activities.PhonePe has a leading 47.2% share of UPI transactions in terms of volume and 50% in value, according to the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). In March this year, PhonePe hit $1 trillion in annualised total payment value run rate helped by increasing share in UPI. The company said it is also making significant investments in new businesses such as insurance and wealth management. Walmart had taken over PhonePe as part of its 2018 acquisition of ecommerce firm Flipkart. Unified Payments Interface (UPI), introduced in 2016, has been a game changer in the payment ecosystem in India, easing payments and transfers, and playing a key role in digital adoption in the country. PhonePe has just become one of the first fintech applications to launch secured credit products for its users in partnership with a bunch of NBFCs. It will offer home loans, two-wheeler loans and such.JFSL super app comes at a time when India's another conglomerate, the Adani Group, is also about to enter fintech. It is likely to apply for a licence to operate on UPI, India's public digital payments network, Financial Times has reported. It is also in talks with banks to launch a co-branded credit card. Adani already has a super app, Adani One, which will be the platform of its financial services business. TOI recently reported that Adani Group chairman, Gautam Adani, is likely considering acquiring a stake in Paytm's parent company One97 Communications, though both the companies have denied it. Adani's acquisition of Paytm parent, if it happens, will position JFSL against a deep-pocketed rival with an entrenched business in its fold.Amid a crowded market, Ambani will be relying on its large physical retail network across India, easy access to consumers, its Jio telecom network, and a huge bank of data that maps consumers' financial lives and will help JFSL target consumers with personalised offerings.",https://m.economictimes.com/industry/banking/finance/mukesh-ambanis-fintech-juggernaut-starts-rolling-the-road-ahead/articleshow/110590569.cms,"Ambani's latest fintech business under Jio Financial Servics Ltd (JFSL)

Playground Global's Peter Barrett on Australia's High-Tech Future,Playground Global's Peter Barrett on Australia's High-Tech Future,"I am Paul Sanger for the Finance News Network, and today I have the pleasure of speaking with Peter Barrett. Peter Barrett, an Australian native, is a globally renowned entrepreneur, investor, and technology leader. He serves as a founding partner of Playground Global, a venture capital fund, managing 1.8 billion in deep, rich tech investments. Playground Global focuses on investing in transformative technology start-ups across various sectors, including AI, next-gen computing, robotics, and quantum technologies. Remarkably, over 20% of Playground's portfolio companies have achieved unicorn stages, with the fund leading a series A investment in PsiQuantum in 2016. Before his venture capital career, Peter held the position of lead engineer at Microsoft. Additionally, he co-founded Rocket Science Games where he notably hired Elon Musk for his first job in Silicon Valley. Peter holds more than 100 patents to his name. Welcome to the network, Peter.Thanks so much for having me.So Peter, let's begin. What prompted your return to Australia?Well, so having grown up here, really want to be able to take advantage of some extraordinary natural resources and intellectual resources in this country. Obviously, with the bold move in quantum with the Queensland and federal government's investment in PsiQuantum, I think it's a first step in many opportunities to translate the really extraordinary natural resources, renewable resources, and capital and intellectual resources we have in Australia, and to allow us to not only lead to the front of the world in quantum, but also in a whole bunch of other domains. We have the best scientists and engineers here, but our economic complexity is between Pakistan and Uganda, and we have everything we need to advance Australia if we invest in the future, and not just in real estate.So Peter, Playground Global focuses its investments on cutting-edge technologies like quantum computing, AI, and advanced semiconductors, all of which promise to have a significant impact across multiple generations. Australia finds itself at a unique juncture presenting a once-in-a-generation opportunity to safeguard its position in the high-tech landscape. How can Australia capitalize on its current strength in specialized sectors where it already holds a competitive edge on the global stage?Yeah, so I think the real opportunity is we have the scientists and engineers that are working at world-class level or above across all of those domains. What's missing is translating that into big companies, translating that into deep-tech start-ups the way Silicon Valley has demonstrated a repeated ability to do, but all the ingredients are here. I think Australia leads in quantum algorithms and in quantum sensing. Now that we have PsiQuantum as a hub, we will be able to deploy capital into Australian startups doing that.I think Australia has the opportunity to turn western Australia from the world's mine into the world's founder using Australian electric chemistry and mining expertise. I think we should be building semiconductor fabs here. There is absolutely everything we need. It's just how do we translate the expertise in academia and the capital we have in the three-and-a-half trillion dollars of Superfund capital? How do we translate that into big companies and do it in Australia rather than have the scientists and entrepreneurs have to move to Silicon Valley in order to build those companies?And the Australian Queensland governments have underscored their commitment to a more ambitious and tech-advanced future through their substantial investment of nearly a billion dollars in a trailblazing quantum computing company, PsiQuantum. How does this groundbreaking investment in a single early stage contribute in the development and utilization of the wider sector in Australia?Yeah, look, I think that Silicon Valley created trillions of dollars of value because the Fairchild guys built their transistors there, built Silicon there. Having PsiQuantum as an anchor in Queensland will create this nexus of opportunity that advantages Australia by having the first useful quantum machine. So there will be quantum startups, there will be people building drugs and materials and applications for quantum that will be drawn into that ecosystem anchored by that PsiQuantum machine. And I think it's an extraordinarily visionary move by the Queensland government and federal government to do that. And I think it proves that there are now thoughtful people who are thinking about ways of transforming the Australian economy to one that is based on, today, exports of simple raw materials, and translate that into exports of intellectual force power, and embracing quantum gives us the sharpest tool in computation we've ever had, and an opportunity to tackle our toughest challenges by building quantum companies and quantum application companies in Australia.And while founded by an Australian, PsiQuantum was established in the USA in order to access the scale of capital required to develop its technology. Despite this, Australia maintains a leading position in the quantum sector globally. How can we, as a nation, improve our efforts to retain local innovation and talent domestically?Yeah, I think it's building an ecosystem, right? It's having preferential access in Australia to things like the PsiQuantum hardware, but also allowing people to stay here and attract capital. Having the machine here is a huge step forward in doing that. Australia publishes on quantum hardware, software algorithms and sensing well above its weight, and I think that we've already attracted academic interest because of that. That's only going to be multiplied by having a machine that's anchoring an ecosystem.And this is to close up Peter, what are the key obstacles preventing Australia from emerging as a dominant global player in technology over the coming decade?So we have all the ingredients. You have world-class scientists and engineers. You have deep capital, you have a geologically and geopolitically stable government structure. Everything is here. Deep, deep pockets of capital, the fourth largest resource of capital in the world. We've just got to figure out how to unlock it and allow that capital to be deployed against building great Australian companies that will transform the Australian economy and put us in a position to have the leadership that we deserve based on all of the richness we have. Nowhere else on earth has the mineral resources or the renewable energy resources that Australia does. We have extraordinary opportunity there. We've just got to figure out how to close the loop on the capital and turn that incredible set of resources into great, deep-tech transformative companies.Peter, it is been a delightful conversation with you today. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me.Thanks so much. Appreciate it.",https://www.finnewsnetwork.com.au/archives/finance_news_network459627.html,"Paul Sanger: I am Paul Sanger for the Finance News Network, and today I

Finance Ministry asks SBI to form committee to tackle co-lending issues,Finance Ministry asks SBI to form committee to tackle co-lending issues,"The Finance Ministry has asked the State Bank of India (SBI) to set up a committee to address issues related to the co-lending business model, said a senior government official who does not wish to be named.

The Reserve Bank of India had allowed banks to co-lend or co-originate loans with non-banking finance companies, including housing finance companies, to enhance the flow of credit to the unserved and underserved sections of the economy. Non-banking finance companies can take a maximum of 20 per cent, according to the norms.

""We've identified some co-lending issues and thus asked SBI to form a committee. This committee will include representatives from major banks and non-banking financial services,"" said the official.

The official further added that SBI will appoint one of its officers to look at why the co-lending space is not picking up.

“The committee will also look at why banks are hesitating to enter the co-lending space. This will also create common ground for both banks and non-banking finance companies. The 80 per cent money comes from banks and 20 per cent from non-banking finance companies. So banks have suggested to us to provide first loss cover, which will ease the banks in this space,” said the official.

On Thursday, the Department of Financial Services convened a meeting with major public sector banks like SBI, Punjab National Bank, National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, Small Industries Development Bank of India, Microfinance Institutions Network, non-banking financial companies, and other microfinance institutions.

""We've encouraged banks and non-banking financial companies to enhance their co-lending activities,"" added the government official.

CRISIL Ratings predicts that the co-lending book of non-banking financial companies will likely reach Rs 1 trillion by June 2024, with a growth rate of 35-40 per cent annually over the medium term.

During the meeting, the Finance Ministry took suggestions from the stakeholders for the upcoming budget and the 100-day agenda as well.

""We discussed various agendas during the meeting, addressing issues from technology to cybersecurity. Some suggestions have been noted for the future budget and the upcoming 100-day agenda,"" said a senior government official.

Regarding the Reserve Bank of India's draft project financing norms, the official said, ""All stakeholders will provide their feedback, which will be consolidated and submitted to the government. The Department of Financial Services will also comment on the draft norms.""

The recent draft guidelines by the banking regulator propose a phased 5 per cent standard asset provision during the construction phase, even for existing projects.

The Finance Minintry has also expressed concerns about the high lending rates of non-banking financial companies. ""We've addressed the issue of high interest rates with non-banking financial companies and directed them to improve their recovery process,"" said the government official.

During the meeting, non-banking financial companies asked the government for the right for Unified Payments Interface access like banks. “Non-banking financial companies have also asked for the permission to issue credit cards,” said a government official.

The Finance Ministry also took a review of the gold loan status of all major public sector banks where they did not find any issue with it.

“We asked some public sector banks to check their gold loan portion and we have not found any issue in it,” said the official.

and Bank of America are worst 3 funders","Annual Banking on Climate Chaos report with an updated methodology offers the most accurate and comprehensive look at who’s bankrolling climate crisis

(As seen in The Guardian, Financial Times, and more – latest media hits linked here)

May 13, 2024, New York, NY — Released today, the 15th annual Banking on Climate Chaos (BOCC) report employs a new, expanded data set that credits each bank making financial contributions to a deal instead of only crediting banks in leading roles. It cuts through greenwash, covering the world’s top 60 banks’ lending and underwriting to over 4,200 fossil fuel companies and the financing of companies causing the degradation of the Amazon and Arctic. Backgrounder of the report’s key findings can be found here.

Since the Paris Agreement in 2016, the world’s 60 largest private banks financed fossil fuels with USD $6.9 trillion. Nearly half – $3.3 trillion – went towards fossil fuel expansion. In 2023, banks financed $705 billion in fossil fuel financing with $347 billion going to fossil fuel expansion alone.

JP Morgan Chase is the #1 fossil fuel financier in the world, committing $40.8 billion dollars to fossil fuel companies in 2023. They’re also #1 for fossil fuel expansion in 2023, while Mizuho shot up to second place in the report in both fossil fuel financing ($37.0 billion) and financing for the expansion of fossil fuels ($18.8 billion). The worst funder of fossil fuel expansion since the Paris Agreement is Citibank, providing $204 billion since 2016.

Recently, some banks increased their exposure to climate risk by rolling back their already weak policies. Bank of America, which ranks third on the 2023 list of worst fossil fuel funders, is a glaring example: they dropped their exclusions on Arctic drilling, thermal coal, and coal-fired power plants; they have neither energy ratio disclosures nor near-term absolute emission targets, and they abandoned the Equator principles. At the time of the report publication, they are the only bank major exhibiting all of these climate policy failures at once.

In an ongoing effort to continually improve the accuracy and breadth of the report, this year’s report has significantly adjusted the methodology by incorporating more primary sources. These sources track bank participation in corporate finance deals, including bonds, loans, and share issuances. Previous years of the report only credited banks in leading roles; this year each banks’ financial contributions to a deal are exposed. Every bank in the report was contacted to confirm and given an opportunity to review the deals attributed to them. A backgrounder of the methodology is here.

The report shows high bank financing for the most climate-damaging fossil fuel practices. In 2023, the worst funders of tar sands extraction are CIBC, RBC, Scotiabank, Toronto-Dominion Bank and Mizuho; while Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) committed $512 million to companies doing ultra deepwater offshore drilling; JP Morgan Chase financed fracking with $6 billion, and CITIC backed coal mining with $7.6 billion. The top 60 banks by asset size unabashedly financed the harmful practices to sensitive biomes: UniCredit committed $265 million to companies involved in Arctic drilling and Bank of America committed to companies extracting oil & gas in the Amazon biome to the tune of $162 million.

Banking on Climate Chaos is authored by Rainforest Action Network, BankTrack, the Center for Energy, Ecology, and Development, Indigenous Environmental Network, Oil Change International, Reclaim Finance, Sierra Club, and Urgewald. It has been endorsed by 589 organizations in 69 countries.

Fossil Fuel Sector Trends

Sector reporting in BOCC 24 is aligned with the Global Oil & Gas Exit List (GOGEL) and the Global Coal Exit List (GCEL), researched by Urgewald. All companies listed by the GOGEL or GCEL that show bank financing in each sector are reported. All companies identified on the GOGEL or GCEL as expansion companies are reported in the expansion league table. Amazon biome companies were identified by Stand.earth Research Group. Metallurgical coal companies were identified through a collaboration between BankTrack and Reclaim Finance.

BOCC quotes from authoring organizations, frontline communities, and politicians:

April Merleaux , Research and Policy Manager at Rainforest Action Network: (co-author)

“Wall Streets’ top concern is its profit. Our top concerns are the climate and human rights. Banks that profit from climate chaos invent new greenwash every year, but we have the receipts that show how much money they put into fossil fuels. Our new methodology uncovers previously unreported details on banks’ support for fossil fuels and gives campaigners new tools to hold them accountable. And bank financing for fossil fuels is not declining nearly fast enough. In 2023, we saw nearly $350 billion financed to companies expanding fossil fuels, which is dangerous and inconsistent with real climate commitments. In a year with record climate impacts, I am shocked to see financing for any category of fossil fuels increase. And yet in 2023 this report shows a big increase in financing to companies developing methane gas terminals and related infrastructure. Banks should be listening to those on the frontlines and stepping away from these projects.”

Gerry Arances, Executive Director at Center for Energy, Ecology & Development (CEED): (co-author)

“Over the last few months, communities across Southeast Asia suffered dangerously high temperatures. Every cruel dollar that still goes to fossil fuels is a death sentence to our climate-vulnerable peoples. SEA does not need the massive gas expansion threatening to bind it to a fossil future and climate chaos. We have more than enough potential for renewables to fully break away from coal and all other fossil fuels in a transition that would also help us build more resilience. Any money still going to fossil fuels is an obstacle to that transition, and it’s historically polluting nations that are largely driving fossil finance. The Japanese government, for instance, is the biggest financier of the fossil gas industry in SEA through its wholly-owned Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC). This has to stop now.”

Diogo Silva, Campaign Lead Banks and Climate, BankTrack: (co-author)

“I dream of a time when we don’t have to produce this report any more, as we would finally be protecting the planet for the next generation. It would mean fossil banks are no more, the fossil fuel era is gone and the just transition to a clean energy economy would now be finally completed. But no: at the same time that fossil pollution is spreading death through record heat, months of rain pouring down in hours, and other once extreme weather events… fossil banks keep banking on climate chaos. As this report is worth nothing if it doesn’t turn into action, we call on the banks to finally become fossil free banks, and on the wider climate justice movement to use this data to mobilize for a fossil free banking world. Later might just be too late. Fossil banks, no thanks!”

Tom BK Goldtooth, Executive Director, Indigenous Environmental Network: (co-author)

“Financiers and investors of fossil fuels continue to light the flame of the climate crisis. Paired with generations of colonialism, the fossil fuel industry and banking institutions’ investment in false solutions create unlivable conditions for all living relatives and humanity on Mother Earth. As Indigenous Peoples, we remain on the frontlines of the climate catastrophe, and the fossil fuel industry targets our lands and territories as sacrifice zones to continue their extraction. Capitalism and its extraction-based economy will only perpetuate more harm and destruction against our Mother Earth and it must come to an end.”

David Tong, Global Industry Campaign Manager at Oil Change International: (co-author)

“The science shows that over half of fossil fuels in existing fields and mines must stay underground to limit global warming to 1.5ºC, and our Big Oil Reality Check analysis finds that none of the major oil and gas companies we analyze plan to do anything even close to what is needed to hold global warming to 1.5°C. By injecting a staggering $708 billion into fossil fuel financing in 2023 alone, the world’s largest banks fund the climate chaos fossil fuel companies wreck on communities worldwide. From fracking to offshore drilling, banks are accelerating our planet’s destruction. It’s time for governments to take urgent action to hold financial institutions accountable for their role in the climate crisis.”

Lucie Pinson, Director and Founder at Reclaim Finance: (co-author)

“European banks like to claim to be showing leadership when it comes to action on climate change, but they are continuing to channel money into fossil fuel expansion, despite the clear warnings from climate science. They appear to be particularly blind to the risks associated with the expansion of LNG, continuing to finance new LNG facilities in the US, Africa and Papua New Guinea, as well as import terminals in Europe. This will lock us into fossil gas for decades to come, adding to greenhouse gas emissions, especially potent emissions of methane. For these banks, recently adopted EU transition planning requirements must mean establishing a strategy to phase out support for fossil fuels, with an immediate halt to financial services provided to their development and the companies responsible for it.”

Adele Shraiman, Senior Strategist for the Sierra Club’s Fossil-Free Finance campaign: (co-author)

“Major banks have squandered yet another year to take decisive and ambitious action on climate. As the crisis worsens, big U.S. banks have stalled on making meaningful progress toward their own net-zero commitments by failing to set sufficient near-term emissions reduction targets and lay out credible plans for restricting financing for polluting companies. The clean energy transition is happening in spite of Wall Street laggards, but the question now is whether they will respond to the growing pressure from investors, customers, regulators, and frontline communities to do what the science and justice demands.”

Katrin Ganswindt, Head of Finance Research at Urgewald: (co-author)

“While we urgently need to exit coal, only 5 percent of global coal companies have announced exit dates for their core business. And while the oil and gas wells in operation are more than enough to fuel us until 2050, 96 percent of oil and gas producers continue to open up new fossil fuel assets. Banks that finance this fossil ignorance are complicit in wrecking our climate. Frontrunners like Credit Mutuel or Banque Postale with strong exclusion policies lead the way to a climate sensitive finance industry.”

Maxwell Atuhura, GreenFaith Uganda organizer & Tasha Research Institute Africa (TASHA) member:

“As local communities and organizations hosting oil projects in Uganda that are supported by irresponsible banks like ICBC who acts as a financial advisor, we have already had dark moments. Our lives and livelihoods have been threatened and we have been arrested for speaking out on Human and Environmental rights violations caused by the East African Crude Oil Pipeline. We want an end to these impacts and to harassment. The solution is for banks and (re)insurers to refuse support for the EACOP and to favour a just transition toward clean energy instead.”

Olivia Bisa, President of the Autonomous Territorial Government of the Chapra Nation:

“Citi talks about respecting the Free, Prior, and Informed Consent of Indigenous communities as set down by the UN, but it has clients like Petroperú which refused to recognize the right to say no of seven Indigenous nations in the Peruvian Amazon. Petroperú’s disregard for Indigenous rights should mean something to the banks that lend them money; but in reality their mutual business continues. If they are serious about Indigenous rights, Citi must hold its clients accountable to ensure that their due diligence adheres to international standards of Free, Prior, and Informed Consent.”

Peter Bosip, Executive Director, Center for Environmental Law and Community Rights, Inc:

“Papua LNG will be bad for the climate, biodiversity, and human rights. French banks have ruled it out, others must too. Papua New Guinea is one of the most biodiverse nations on the planet, with great possibilities for renewables. We want clean energy and climate justice – not fossil gas that will trash nature and chain our economy to a dying industry.”

Orlando Carriqueo, Werquen (Messenger) of the Mapuche Tehuelche Parliment of Rio Negro:

“Fracking in Vaca Muerta leads to water pollution, the loss of animals, and fruit plants wither. The public hearings have been closed to dissenting voices, and we haven’t been able to participate. It’s the same colonialist process as five hundred years ago. In the midst of an overwhelming process of unbridled capitalism, which plunders territories and produces climate change, we are calling for an awakening to think about other models of development, more compatible with the earth.”

Tori Cress, Keepers of the Water; Anishinaabe (Ojibway and Pottawattami) from G’Chimnissing, an island community on the shores of Georgian Bay in Williams Treaty Territory:

“This report shows that Canada’s Big Five banks — RBC, CIBC, BMO, TD and Scotia — hold half of all global banks’ tar sands investment, proving what we’ve known all along: tar sands is a bad investment financially, for our health, and for our entire planet. We are dying from the pollution caused by Canada’s banks tar sands financing, including their expansion of this destruction. Indigenous people in our homelands have been the sacrifice zone, and we say: no more. We decide our future.”

Neil Encinas, Leader for the Autonomous Territorial Government of the Wampís Nation:

“The more than 85 communities that make up the integral territory of the Wampís National oppose the entry of oil operations into their territories. In our territory we suffered the irresponsibility of Petroperú in the past, which caused the largest oil spill in all of Latin America. Now we face a new threat. Petroperú needs to activate oil wells in our territory to pay the debts it has acquired from commercial banks such as JP Morgan Chase.”

Senar Irar, President of the Peruvian Federation of Achuar Nation:

“We have traveled (to the United States) from far away to explain to the banks that have invested in Petroperú that this company is trying to open new oil wells in our territories in order to pay them back. The desperation to pay back the money lended by the banks for the construction of their refinery is causing conflicts and even death threats among us who reject the activity.”

Juan Mancias, Tribal Chair, Carrizo/Comecrudo Tribe of Texas

“The fossil fuel industry is trying to hold onto control of the status quo. We know another way is possible. It’s critical to link international communities, to grow our independence off fossil fuels. 500 years later, the powers that be are still trying to colonize our communities by extracting and exporting resources from our lands, along with their accomplices – the banks and insurance companies.”

Chief Na’Moks, Wet’suwet’en Hereditary Chief

“After facing silencing and censorship at RBC’s April shareholder meeting, this report shows that Canada’s banks are still financing billions of dollars in fossil fuels, perpetuating violence against Indigenous peoples, Mother Earth, and all of us. It’s not just RBC: we are strengthening our sovereignty by connecting dirty banks’ roles in fossil fuel project that endanger communities across Turtle Island and around the world. Canada’s banks costs for financing fossil fuels will only continue to rise without taking bold action to respect Indigenous sovereignty and our rights.”

Roishetta Ozane, Founder/Director of Vessel Project

“As major banks and insurance companies continue to finance and insure projects such as LNG and Petrochemical Industries that pose a threat to communities, it is imperative that we educate our communities and fight back.” Ozane is a Sulphur, Louisiana resident and mom of 6, and is also the Finance Coordinator for the Texas Campaign for the Environment.

Khairiyah Rahmanyah of Chana Local Reservation Network:

“Fossil fuels harm our environment and go against our principles of sustainable development. Our life depends on nature, so we work together towards a future that protects it. In Chana, Thailand, we believe in a future shaped by our community’s values and way of life, charting a path towards a more sustainable future.”

US Congressman Ro Khanna:

“The science is clear: to tackle today’s climate crisis we must hold Big Oil accountable for its role in the climate crisis. Unfortunately, this report shows that banks are continuing to finance projects that will increase emissions, despite their public climate commitments. Wall Street shouldn’t be financing the climate crisis while too many Americans are facing financial harm because of climate change. We must move towards a clean energy future and hold big banks accountable for their pledges.”

US Senator Ed Markey:

“This year’s report is clear – banks are gambling our future on risky investments that fuel the climate crisis. In 2023 alone, banks invested more than $700 billion in fossil fuels despite having net-zero commitments. Let’s keep these big banks accountable, not just counting on fossil fuels. Instead, we should invest in our future and pass my Fossil Free Finance Act now.”

Housing Finance Startup Altum Credo Raises $40 Mn In Series C,Housing Finance Startup Altum Credo Raises $40 Mn In Series C,"The company had an AUM of INR 830 Cr, with 93% of customers from the economically weaker section or low-income group category, as of March 2024

Altum Credo plans to use the fresh funds to achieve AUM growth by further enhancing its distribution network and expanding its operational footprint in central and northern India

The company said that it has raised $27 Mn in equity and facilitated a partial exit to Series A investors of $13 Mn.

Housing finance startup Altum Credo has raised around $40 Mn (INR 334 Cr) in its Series C funding round co-led by Z3Partners and Oikocredit, with participation from British International Investment and other existing investors, including Aavishkaar Capital and Amicus Capital.

The company said that it has raised $27 Mn in equity and facilitated a partial exit to Series A investors of $13 Mn.

Altum Credo plans to use the fresh funds to achieve AUM growth by further enhancing its distribution network and expanding its operational footprint. The round will also help the company to remain well-capitalised in the near term and support growth, it said.

Founded in 2017, Altum Credo has been enabling tech-driven affordable housing finance in the country. It is focused on the largely untapped potential of unserved and under-served segments and targets first-time homeowners.

The company raised $9.8 Mn in its Series A funding round and $12 Mn in Series B equity funding in 2018 and 2021, respectively.

As of March 2024, Altum Credo had an AUM of INR 830 Cr, with 93% of customers from the economically weaker section or low-income group category. Its customer base comprises salaried customers from both formal and informal segments and self-employed proprietors of small and medium enterprises who largely belong to low-income groups.

The average ticket size of its home loan portfolio is INR 8.5 Lakh, with an average tenure of 15 years. With a loan-to-value ratio below 50%, the average value of the properties the company funded is around INR 15-25 Lakh.

Vikrant Bhagwat, founder, MD and CEO of Altum Credo, said that at a time when the Indian economy is touching new heights, access to affordable housing finance has immense potential to contribute towards this growth.

“This Series C fund raise is a critical milestone for the next phase of sustainable growth and will strengthen our balance sheet enabling effective leverage and sound ALM (asset and liability management). The company will enhance its distribution network and expand operations in central and northern India,” said Bhagwat.

Altum Credo currently operates in semi-urban and outskirts of urban areas in six states – Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan.

“We believe the company is at an inflection point where physical and digital infrastructure comes together to provide industry-leading operational metrics,” said Rishi Maheshwari, managing partner at Z3Partners.

“This investment fits into our core thesis of technology being a catalyst to financially empower the underserved segment of Bharat, while also building businesses in a profitable and scalable manner.”

As per a recent CareEdge Ratings report, affordable housing finance companies saw a resurgence in growth during FY23, expanding by 27% year-on-year. It is expected to further grow by 29% in FY24 and 30% in FY25.",https://inc42.com/buzz/housing-finance-startup-altum-credo-raises-40-mn-to-scale-up-distribution-network/,"The company said that it has raised $27 Mn in equity and facilitated a

RBI’s scrutiny on credit cards : The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has intensified its scrutiny on co-branded credit cards , a sector that has witnessed significant growth recently. This aims to prevent unauthorised entry into the tightly regulated credit card industry, informed sources told ET.They mentioned that the central bank aims to tighten regulations on co-branded credit cards.The founder of a fintech startup operating in this field stated that the regulator has previously raised concerns about data sharing between co-branding partners. They emphasised the importance of brands solely serving as sourcing or marketing channels for co-branded cards, rather than allowing unregulated entities to exploit them for access to the tightly regulated credit card sector.The person highlighted that non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) have been seeking approval to issue credit cards for years. However, the regulator has only permitted a few banks to issue these cards. The founder added that the RBI desires the growth of co-branded cards but insists that it must occur within a regulated framework.The central bank issued a directive on March 7, requiring all co-branded card issuers to prominently display the name of the issuing bank. Additionally, it instructed co-branding partners not to access any transaction information of the cardholder.Additionally, in a circular issued on March 6, the RBI prohibited banks from entering into exclusive agreements with card networks such as Visa, American Express, andMastercard . This move aims to provide customers with multiple card network options.Last month, the central bank imposed restrictions on business and commercial payments made through credit cards. According to industry estimates, B2B vendor payments through credit cards were totaling Rs 30,000 crore per month, nearly 20% of total credit card spending. However, these transactions have now been halted.Many major brands offer credit cards to their customers through co-branding arrangements. For instance, Swiggy issued approximately 120,000 HDFC Bank cards, while Tata Neu issued around one million of them. Additionally, as of December 2023, ICICI Bank issued more than 4.7 million cards through Amazon Pay.As per RBI data, ICICI Bank has a total of 16 million cards issued, while HDFC Bank has approximately 20 million cards issued. Presently, the total number of credit cards in the country has reached 99.5 million, up from 70 million in January 2022.

most","While institutions invested in Satin Creditcare Network Limited (NSE:SATIN) 
benefited from last week's 13% gain, private companies stood to gain the 
most","Key Insights

The considerable ownership by private companies in Satin Creditcare Network indicates that they collectively have a greater say in management and business strategy

A total of 2 investors have a majority stake in the company with 57% ownership



To get a sense of who is truly in control of Satin Creditcare Network Limited ( ), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 51% to be precise, is private companies. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).

Private companies gained the most after market cap touched ₹24b last week, while institutions who own 20% also benefitted.

Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Satin Creditcare Network, beginning with the chart below.

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Satin Creditcare Network?

Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.

As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Satin Creditcare Network. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Satin Creditcare Network's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.

Satin Creditcare Network is not owned by hedge funds. Trishashna Holdings & Investments Private Limited is currently the largest shareholder, with 43% of shares outstanding. Florintree Advisors Pvt ltd, Investment Arm is the second largest shareholder owning 14% of common stock, and Rajsonia Consultancy Services Private Limited holds about 2.9% of the company stock.

A more detailed study of the shareholder registry showed us that 2 of the top shareholders have a considerable amount of ownership in the company, via their 57% stake.

Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There is some analyst coverage of the stock, but it could still become more well known, with time.

Insider Ownership Of Satin Creditcare Network

The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.

I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.

Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Satin Creditcare Network Limited. In their own names, insiders own ₹469m worth of stock in the ₹24b company. Some would say this shows alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. But it might be worth checking

General Public Ownership

The general public-- including retail investors -- own 13% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.

Private Equity Ownership

With a stake of 14%, private equity firms could influence the Satin Creditcare Network board. Some investors might be encouraged by this, since private equity are sometimes able to encourage strategies that help the market see the value in the company. Alternatively, those holders might be exiting the investment after taking it public.

Private Company Ownership

We can see that Private Companies own 51%, of the shares on issue. Private companies may be related parties. Sometimes insiders have an interest in a public company through a holding in a private company, rather than in their own capacity as an individual. While it's hard to draw any broad stroke conclusions, it is worth noting as an area for further research.

Next Steps:

While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Be aware that , and 2 of those don't sit too well with us...

Sustainable Finance in Geneva,Sustainable Finance in Geneva,"What is Sustainable Finance

Sustainable finance refers to the process of taking environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations into account when making financing decisions in the financial sector, leading to more long-term financing of sustainable economic activities and projects for the lasting benefit of both clients and society at large. Environmental considerations might include climate change mitigation and adaptation, preservation of biodiversity, pollution prevention and circular economy. Social considerations could refer to issues of inequality, inclusiveness, labour relations, investment in human capital and communities, as well as human rights issues.

By adopting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in 2015, the member states of the UN declared their willingness to jointly meet the 17 Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. In 2015, governments also committed to maintaining global warming under 2°C compared to pre-industrial levels through the Paris Agreement. Subsequently, various countries have pledged to reach net-zero in the upcoming decades. Achieving the targets set by the SDGs and the Paris Agreement will require that significant amounts of money be invested in these areas.

Therefore, sustainability topics are increasingly shaping the financial market and sustainable financing has risen sharply, for banks, wealth management and investment advice, as well as pension funds and insurance companies. For example, sustainable financial investment in Switzerland surged from CHF 141.7 billion in 2015 to over CHF 1,163 billion in 2019.

UN Frameworks for Sustainable Finance

The Geneva-based UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI), the UN’s largest partnership with the finance industry, supports global finance sector principles to catalyze integration of sustainability into financial market practice. The frameworks UNEP FI has established or co-created include:

Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB) launched with more than 130 banks collectively holding USD 47 trillion in assets, or one third of the global banking sector, on 22 September 2019.

Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI), established 2012 by UNEP FI and today applied by one-quarter of the world’s insurers (25% of world premium).

Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), established in 2006 by UNEP FI and the UN Global Compact, now applied by half the world’s institutional investors (USD 83 trillion).

These frameworks establish the norms for sustainable finance, providing the basis for standard-setting and helping to ensure private finance fulfils its potential role in contributing to achieving the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement.

Sustainable Finance and Climate

Climate change is referred to by leading economists as the greatest market failure in human history, with potentially disruptive implications on the social well-being, economic development, and financial stability of current and future generations. As a result, decision-makers around the world are faced with the dual imperative of rapidly reducing greenhouses gas emissions to mitigate climate change and adapting societies to the unavoidable impacts of global warming.

The finance sector, lying at the heart of today’s global markets, faces the same challenges, but it also is presented with the vast financial opportunities associated with overhauling economies towards climate-compatibility. On the one hand, new risks need to be understood, identified, assessed, managed, and eventually disclosed on, by institutions across financial industries. On the other hand, the transition to low-carbon and climate-resilient economies will require additional investment at an order of magnitude of at least USD 60 trillion, from now until 2050.

Therefore, financial institutions need to improve their understanding of the risks and opportunities implied. Meanwhile, public decision-makers need to investigate how they can help steer the finance sector to become an enabler, rather than inhibitor, of the climate economic transition.

Sustainable Finance for Nature

The businesses that we finance, invest in and insure depend on nature and biodiversity. The world’s ocean, forests and lands provide much of the raw materials, goods and services which underpin the global economy. At risk from over-exploitation and environmental degradation, there is an urgent need to manage these natural assets more effectively in order to ensure the health and wellbeing of society, and stability of businesses and the financial system at the heart of the economy. The financial community has a critical role to play in safeguarding this stock of natural capital, through financing, insuring and investing in companies in the real economy.

The UNEP-FI released Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB) Nature Target Setting Guidance aim at helping the banking industry align with the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) and address nature and biodiversity loss. Developed with 34 PRB signatories and key external stakeholders, the industry-first guidance aims to integrate nature considerations into the core practices and processes of banks while mobilising financial resources to bridge the annual $700 billion biodiversity finance gap.

Role of Geneva

As a hub for multilateral governance and a global financial centre, Geneva is uniquely positioned to address the challenges of finance for achieving the SDGs. Geneva is indeed the home of many international organizations – including the leading UN partnership with the finance industry focusing on sustainable finance (UNEP FI) – as well as academic, non-governmental and private institutions active in the finance sector.

UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI)

UNEP FI is a partnership between UNEP and the global financial sector to mobilize private sector finance for sustainable development. UNEP FI works with nearly 400 members – banks, insurers, and investors – and over 100 supporting institutions – to help create a financial sector that serves people and planet while delivering positive impacts. By leveraging the UN’s role, UNEP FI accelerates sustainable finance with the aim to inspire, inform and enable financial institutions to improve people’s quality of life without compromising that of future generations.

Sustainable Finance Geneva (SFG)

SFG is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting sustainable finance, comprising individual members and institutional partners. Together, they represent a one-of-a-kind ecosystem that embodies the diversity of Geneva and its determination to make sustainable finance the “new normal”. SFG promotes and encourages synergies to put Geneva on the map as one of the world’s top centres for sustainable finance through its newsletter, projects and market studies, events, and more.

Swiss Lab for Sustainable Finance (SL4SF)

The Swiss Lab for Sustainable Finance, inaugurated in September 2021, is a multistakeholder and transdisciplinary initiative promoting research and practice in finance conducted by its members. It cooperates with Swiss Sustainable Finance, Sustainable Finance Geneva, the Swiss federal and cantonal governments, international organizations, the private sector, universities from low-­‐income countries, and research centres under one (virtual) roof to achieve significant applied research impact on sustainable finance.

Swiss Sustainable Finance (SSF)

SSF strengthens the position of Switzerland in the global marketplace for sustainable finance by informing, educating and catalyzing growth. The association, founded in 2014, has representation in Zurich, Geneva and Lugano. Currently SSF unites 173 members and network partners from financial service providers, investors, universities and business schools, public sector entities and other interested organisations.

Financial Centres for Sustainability (FC4S)

The FC4S Network is a growing collective of the world’s financial centres, born out of Italy’s G7 Presidency in 2017, where green finance was a central theme of the agenda. FC4S supports its members to align themselves with the SDGs and the Paris Agreement, while providing research and guidance on emerging issues and best practices.

More actors from the Geneva ecosystem

The Canton of Geneva, Sustainable Finance Geneva, IISD and the SDG Lab at the UN Geneva conducted a mapping of the institutions active in sustainable finance in Geneva and the Swiss Romande.

Ethical money lender Money Sweetspot, which is still in its first year of operation, took home the Social Impactor Award at this year’s Sustainable Business Network Awards.

The recent Sustainable Business Network Awards recognised Kiwi businesses working towards a sustainable future through innovation to address climate change, rebuilding resilient natural systems, reducing waste and building greener supply chains.

Ethical lender Money Sweetspot, which is still in its first year of operation, took home the Social Impactor Award, recognising the change it has helped make for its 400-plus customers with $10 million of consumer debt.

Money Sweetspot offers debt consolidation finance, financial education and rewards, all aimed at getting people out of debt and on with life.

As the judge’s said, “Money Sweetspot is the first social lender of its type with a better way for the under-served to refinance their debt. At the core of the organisation is a tech platform that resets lives by re-empowering clients. Money Sweetspot gives back to the community and other social causes.”

Money Sweetspot co-founder and CEO Sasha Lockley agrees that it is a win-win business model. “Customers win, because they move on from debt. Investors win, because they still get a fair social and financial return. Communities win, through the donations our customers make,” she says.

“Lenders who prefer to keep their customers in debt don’t win… but I’m absolutely fine with that.”

This is the latest recent recognition for Money Sweetspot, following two finalists at the 2degrees Auckland Business Awards and a win at the GEN NZ Entrepreneurial Ecosystem Awards.

Looking ahead, Sasha says the focus for Money Sweetspot is all about being able to help more motivated Kiwis on their financial reset journey.

“We’ve built something that works and is changing lives. With over 400,000 Kiwis juggling their financial commitments, we know the demand is there. With even more lending capital this can be really transformational.”

Access Finance co-founder Chigogwana retires,Access Finance co-founder Chigogwana retires,"Business Reporter

Access Finance Group, whose strategic network of operations includes Zimbabwe, has appointed Mr Salim Eceolaza as the new chief executive.

Mr Eceolaza is succeeding co-founder Mr Raymond Chigogwana, who retires October 1, 2023.

Access Finance International is a Mauritius-based holding company that offers a broad spectrum of specialist financial solutions to a client base that includes corporate entities, public institutions, and private individuals.

It has a deep footprint in Africa and a strategic network of operations in Mauritius, the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Zimbabwe.

The group, in a statement, said: “Eceolaza, who joins the business as a representative shareholder, has subsequently also been appointed to the group board, while Chigogwana will continue to support the business as a non-executive director of the same board,” the group said.

The company’s board described the leadership transition as a monumental evolution that would launch the next strategic cycle of the financial powerhouse.

“Since its establishment in 2014 and under Chigogwana’s leadership, Access has led the way in local and international remittances, fintech, and investment banking within the region,” the company said.

Mr Isau Bwerinofa, the group’s chairman, said during Mr Chigogwana’s tenure, Access focused on leading global money services businesses while consolidating its investment banking portfolio.

“Under his leadership, the technology and innovation pipeline was revitalized, and we successfully navigated the evolution of our remittance products.

“We anticipate a smooth transition as Ray (Chigigwana) built a strong leadership team and has been mentoring his successor for some time. Access will be well positioned to continue its momentum,” he said.

Commenting on his retirement, Mr Chigogwana said: “From a strategic, professional, and personal perspective, this is the right moment to hand the leadership reins of the company to Salim (Eceolaza). Our strong network and the strategic moves we have taken to focus the company have put Access on a strong path for the future.”

Mr Eceolaza is a seasoned executive with a track record of identifying and realizing business growth opportunities and adding value to businesses.

Prior to his appointment as CEO, Mr Eceolaza served as the first group finance director for Simbisa Brands Limited, steering its unbundling from Innscor Africa Limited and subsequently overseeing its listing on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange.

Thereafter, he was appointed as the managing director of the Simbisa group’s Kenyan arm, where he further demonstrated his ability to significantly grow business performance and operations.

Prior to this, Mr Eceolaza co-founded IH Group, a prominent capital markets advisory and corporate finance business with a distinct focus on the Zimbabwean market.

Mr Bwerinofa says the new CEO brings the unique vantage point of experience as an entrepreneur, corporate executive, and business operator, as well as group experience and networks that will serve the valued clients and business partners of the Access Finance Group.

“His mandate will be to solidify the group’s positioning on the global stage, grow our financial inclusion competitiveness, and strengthen our relationships with local and group partners,” he said.

India is home to a thriving business finance industry. In 2023, there are numerous companies that offer financing solutions to businesses ranging from small and medium enterprises to large corporations.

These companies provide a wide range of services, such as loan syndication, venture capital funding, asset-based lending, bridge financing, factoring, invoice discounting and much more. Most of these companies have branches across the country and have strong ties with local financial institutions and markets.

The Indian business finance sector is highly competitive and has seen significant growth in recent years. The main players in this industry include leading banks like ICICI, HDFC, and Axis Bank, NBFCs such as Bajaj Finance and Muthoot Finance, and specialized companies such as Capital Float, Indifi Technologies, Lendingkart Technologies and InCred. These companies offer attractive interest rates and flexible repayment options, making them popular among borrowers.

The Government of India also provides several schemes and initiatives to promote business financing. The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) is one such scheme which aims to provide micro and small loans up to Rs 10 lakh to businesses. Similarly, the Stand-up India scheme offers loans up to Rs 1 crore to help women, SC/ST entrepreneurs, and other economically weaker sections of society set up their own enterprises.

Overall, the business finance industry in India is growing rapidly and is expected to reach new heights in 2023. With the introduction of various government and private schemes, businesses of all sizes will be able to access financing and grow their operations further.

IMPORTANCE

In 2023, the importance of business finance companies in India is expected to rise significantly. This is due to the country’s rapidly-growing economy and continued efforts to promote financial inclusion. Business finance companies provide a variety of services, such as loans and lines of credit, to small businesses that may not have access to traditional bank financing.

Business finance companies are also becoming increasingly important for large corporations that need access to capital more quickly than banks can provide. With the Indian government’s focus on creating a strong and vibrant economy, the role of business finance companies is becoming even more important.

Business finance companies offer a number of advantages over traditional banking options. For instance, they often provide quicker access to funds than banks and have less stringent qualification requirements for borrowers. This makes them an ideal choice for many early-stage business owners or those with bad credit histories. Additionally, these firms usually offer competitive rates and flexible repayment terms.

Business finance companies also help to create new jobs. They provide short-term capital to business owners, which helps them launch their businesses and expand operations. This, in turn, creates employment opportunities in the local economy. Moreover, these firms often assist businesses in accessing new markets and customers, helping them to grow and generate greater profits.

Overall, business finance companies are essential for India’s economic growth and financial stability. As the economy continues to grow and develop, the role of business finance companies will become even more important. By providing access to capital and other financial services, these firms will continue to be an integral part of the country’s success story.

Students Network with Major Finance Firms in Chicago and St. Louis,Students Network with Major Finance Firms in Chicago and St. Louis,"May 9, 2023

BLOOMINGTON, Ill. ⁠— During the spring semester, members of two registered student organizations at Illinois Wesleyan University had the opportunity to network with professionals at top-tier finance firms during trips to Chicago and St. Louis.

Students with the Women in Finance RSO and Investments/Trading Club visited Chicago on March 24 where they explored three nationally and internationally recognized finance firms: BMO Harris, Northern Trust and the Chicago Board Options Exchange. On April 14, the groups traveled to St. Louis to meet with NISA Investment Advisors, one of the largest investment firms in the U.S.; and Edward Jones.

Illinois Wesleyan students with the Women in Finance RSO and Investments/Trading Club visited the Chicago Board Options Exchange.

The trips, funded in part by supportive alumni, were coordinated by Assistant Professor of Finance Mikhail Munenzon who serves as the faculty advisor for both RSOs.

“Students were very engaged and happy to experience what high-level finance professional careers, environments and expectations might look and feel like, instead of just talking about it with me,” said Professor Munenzon.

During the visits, students attended presentations and spoke with senior and junior staff, floor traders and heads of departments. Finance major William Duff '25, co-founder of the Investments/Tragin Club said “it was phenomenal” to interact with senior staff members from several of the banks while on the Chicago trip.

“Hearing about their career path and being able to ask them questions on what intrigued them to pursue a career in finance was exactly what we were looking for. In addition to that, we got to see the inside of their state-of-the-art downtown offices, which blew my mind away,” said Duff.

""These trips are building connections that lead to recruiting relationships between the high-level employers and IWU students pursuing finance careers, with students already getting internships and full-time positions at such firms due to unique skills and training they bring to their employers,"" said Professor Munenzon.

He added that IWU finance graduates stand out to employers due to their “exposure to fields and perspectives outside of finance” from a liberal arts education, as well as their access to The Greg Yess '82 Bloomberg Finance Lab.

“Bloomberg-based training provides unique, experiential, state-of-the-art finance learning. Bloomberg Terminals are used by

top investment and financial institutions to analyze, research, trade and invest in markets around the world. Very few universities have a Bloomberg Lab because of the expense involved, though they are invaluable for real-life industry knowledge,” said Professor Munenzon.

Klaudia Wyszynski '23, co-founder of the Women in Finance RSO, said it was a fulfilling experience to speak with leaders in the reputable finance companies — and she hopes to use those connections to expand her professional network.

She is also eager to see campus groups collaborate more often on shared interests and passions.

“I hope both RSOs continue to work together to strengthen their relationship, as I know they both offer extraordinary experiences to their members,” said Wyszynski, finance major.

Marco Polo Network runs insolvent with €5.2m debts,Marco Polo Network runs insolvent with €5.2m debts,"Irish company Marco Polo Network Operations (Ireland) Limited has been appointed to administrators following a court ruling declaring the company insolvent on Wednesday, 22 February.

According to the Irish Times, Marco Polo Network intended to close a strategic $12 million (£10 million) deal with Bank of America, which fell through.

The court ruling on 22 February heard that the Marco Polo Network has debts of more than €5.2 million (£4.6 million) and its current liabilities exceed the total value of assets by €2.5 million (£2.2 million).

The Marco Polo Network claims a significant investment into developing a product to replace Bank of America’s own internal account automation service, an important step in Bank of America’s investment, the court ruling heard.

Just 9 months after the collapse of we.trade, along with Serai, HSBC backed blockchain-based trade platform, serious questions continue to be raised around the commercial viability.

In the previous TFG article 6 lessons from the tradetech industry, former Marco Polo Network director Daniel Cotti told TFG: “Five years ago, it was all about technology and blockchain. We have learned that technology is an enabler through which you can offer services and connect with partners and clients, but it is not the sole driver for a successful business.

Though many industry actors thought blockchain would be the holy grail of the trade finance industry, this proved not to be the case. What actually counts are well-designed and well-thought-out value propositions that solve real day-to-day corporate problems.”

The Marco Polo Network, founded in 2017, was a blockchain-based platform aiming to streamline and simplify global trade finance processes.

It was a collaboration between technology firm TradeIX and enterprise software company R3, utilizing R3’s Corda blockchain technology to enable secure and efficient communication and data exchange between different parties involved in international trade transactions, primarily open account finance.

The network allowed banks and financial institutions, corporates, and third-party service providers to share and exchange trade data in real-time, improving the transparency and efficiency of trade finance processes.

By utilising blockchain technology, the Marco Polo Network also aimed to reduce the risk of fraud and errors in trade finance by providing a single, tamper-proof source of truth for all parties involved.

Some of the key features of the Marco Polo Network include the ability to track and manage trade transactions from end to end, automate the process of trade finance through smart contracts, and provide real-time visibility into trade data and financing options.

The Marco Polo Network operates following a license and transaction fee model.

Andre Casterman, managing director, Casterman Advisory and fintech board member, International Trade & Forfaiting Association (ITFA), told TFG:

“Collaborative innovations in trade finance are the most complex to get off the ground. The only way to succeed is to focus on specific functions or processes and embed those into the trade and trade finance ecosystems.

The [Marco Polo] situation is not the first and will not be the last one. Focusing on one segment, or one function to bring the most specialised value proposition is my only advice to those entering the trade space. Don’t try to change what’s working pretty fine. The incremental value risks to be too low.

This has been my approach when I set up both DNI Initiative and TFD Initiative – respectively with Enigio and Tradeteq. We focus on adding new differentiating value. We avoid changing practices systems and channels, rather we add new highly specialised Tradetech components for the market to take advantage of. At this stage, the recipe works very well and many stakeholders are benefiting.”

To date, the Marco Polo Network claimed many proof of concept transactions. Using this proof of concept programme, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC) completed a receivables finance and payment commitment transaction in 2019. Furthermore, in 2021 Marco Polo executed an accounts receivable discounting transaction with a Japanese corporate client.

Why are blockchain tradetechs facing so many challenges?

There are several reasons why blockchain-based trade technology companies are struggling in the market:

Lack of adoption: One of the biggest challenges for blockchain-based trade technology companies is the lack of adoption. Despite the potential benefits of blockchain technology, many companies are hesitant to adopt it because it requires significant changes in their existing systems and processes. This reluctance to adopt new technology can make it difficult for blockchain-based trade technology companies to gain traction in the market. Regulatory uncertainty: Another challenge facing blockchain-based trade technology companies is regulatory uncertainty. Governments and regulatory bodies around the world are still trying to figure out how to regulate blockchain technology, which can create uncertainty for companies operating in this space. This uncertainty can make it difficult for companies to secure funding and grow their business. The Marco Polo Network court ruling also claimed that Bank of America had reticence around blockchain investments following the FTX collapse. Limited scalability: Another issue with blockchain technology is limited scalability. Current blockchain systems can only handle a limited number of transactions per second, which can be a bottleneck for companies that need to process a high volume of transactions. This limitation can make it difficult for blockchain-based trade technology companies to compete with traditional systems that can process a much higher volume of transactions. High costs: Developing and implementing blockchain-based trade technology can be expensive. This can make it difficult for startups and small businesses to enter the market and compete with larger, more established companies. In addition, the cost of running a blockchain network can be high, which can be a barrier to entry for companies that are trying to operate on a tight budget. Lack of interoperability: Finally, another challenge facing blockchain-based trade technology companies is the lack of interoperability between different blockchain networks. This can make it difficult for companies to work together and share data, which can limit the potential benefits of blockchain technology. Until there is greater interoperability between different blockchain networks, it may be difficult for blockchain-based trade technology companies to gain widespread adoption.

Finland finance ministry backs ‘identity trust network’ initiative,Finland finance ministry backs ‘identity trust network’ initiative,"Finland’s government is to fund a public-private initiative to build a ‘self-governing identity trust network experimental environment’ for digital data and information exchanges in the country.

The Ministry of Finance is providing a €3m (about £2.6m) grant to the Findynet Cooperative during 2022–2024 to develop a trial setting in which both public- and private-sector actors can develop and deploy solutions that take advantage of verifiable data sharing, digital wallets and self-sovereign identities in the European Union (EU) member state.

The consortium, whose membership currently comprises one public sector organisation and eight companies, is looking to lay the foundation for the operation of a Finnish network of self-managed identities that would comply with and capitalise on the EU’s evolving cross-border legal framework for trusted digital identities – the eIDAS regulation (which stands for ’electronic identification, authentication and trust services’). The eIDAS regulation is currently being reviewed.

Verifiable data is not limited to financial transactions data – it could include, for example, certificates or qualifications issued to individuals (such as degree certificates and professional qualifications) or to companies and organisations (such as compliance certificates or authorisations to conduct regulated business).

The aim is to have a test network available later this year, with a pilot network available during the first half of 2024 and production-level capabilities ready by the end of 2024.

Digital investment ambition

The broader ambition of the public-private co-operation is to ‘strengthen Finland’s leading position in digitalisation and support the emergence of investments in new digital services,’ Findynet stated in a press release.

“We are very happy to have received this government grant, which allows us to continue our long-term work with public- and private-sector actors and build a trust network covering all of society,” Findynet Cooperative board chairman Markus Hautala said in the release.

Finland, which has a population of about 5.5 million people, has been an EU member state since 1995. The European Commission revealed plans for an EU-wide digital ID wallet – a pan-European ecosystem of interoperable wallets that the 450 million residents of the 27-nation bloc would be able to use to prove their identity and access services online – last year.

Reacting to the proposal at the time, the Findy Cooperative made reference to the Trust Over IP Foundation. Hosted by the California-headquartered Linux Foundation, the Trust Over IP Foundation was established in May 2020 and is seeking to define a ‘complete architecture for internet-scale digital trust that combines both cryptographic trust at the machine layer and human trust at the business, legal and social layers’.

‘Building on the Trust Over IP Foundation model for digital trust architecture, the Findy Cooperative has been working on a self-sovereign principle-based approach for verified data-sharing for more than two years,’ the Findy Cooperative stated. ‘Specifically, Findy Cooperative proposes to collaborate with the Finnish public authorities to ensure that the proposal made by the Commission can be implemented to its fullest potential in Finland. This requires systematic and determined public-private cooperation as well as joint vision to establish Finland as a leading member state driving the adoption of European digital identity.’

‘Common network’ better than ‘islands’

Findynet Cooperative’s public sector member organisation is the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela). Its private-sector members are Finance Finland, Finnish Post, Nixu, Nordea, OP Financial Group, Technology Finland, Tietoevry and Vastuu Group.

Findy members have developed various concepts in recent years that rely on the existence of a self-sovereign identity (SSI) network. Examples include, in 2018, companies working with public authorities to jointly develop what was described as the ‘world’s first blockchain technology-based business network that enables establishing limited liability companies fully digitally’; and, in 2019, the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela) and TietoEVRY undertaking a proof-of-concept to develop a digital payment guarantee (‘smart money’) in the context of rehabilitative psychotherapy.

“We understood that the first-needed building block is the SSI network,” Hautala told Global Government Fintech this week. “It might be possible to launch some of those concepts with a limited-scale purpose-built SSI network. However, since all need the same capability, it will bring a lot synergies to launch a common national network instead of creating separate islands.”

The trust network being developed would be Finland-specific. However, Findy’s network has an eye on cross-border interoperability with other similar (national or cross-border) trust networks, especially in the context of the eIDAS review. This would means that credentials issued using Findy Network as underlying trust registry could be used in EU Digital Identity (EUDI) wallets and thus in cross-border interactions.

‘Digital Europe Programme’ proposals

The European Commission launched a ‘Digital Europe Programme’ (DEP) funding call for proposals – one component of which being to fund cross-border pilots of European wallet applications – in February.

Finnish government entities have applied to the Commission for funding to pilot European wallet applications as part of three different consortia.

In the ‘POTENTIAL’ consortium led by France and Germany, Finland’s main goal is to pilot a mobile driving licence (the responsible parties in Finland are the Ministry of Finance, Digital and Population Data Services Agency and traffic agency Traficom); in a Sweden-led ‘EU DI Wallet Consortium (EWC)’, with Finland focusing on companies’ digital identities and corporate wallets (on the Finnish side, the Ministry of Finance, Digital and Population Data Services Agency, the Finnish Patent and Registration Office and Tax Administration are involved); and in a Spanish-led ‘DC4EU’ consortium, Finland is focusing on piloting the utilisation of higher education diplomas in EU digital identity wallets (the responsible parties in Finland are the Ministry of Finance, Digital and Population Data Services Agency and the Finnish National Agency for Education – OPH). The Commission is due to publish funding decisions in December.

Findy Cooperative is itself taking part in the EWC Consortium in the role of an associated partner (meaning that it would not be funded by the Commission but may provide some capabilities to ensure the successful delivery of the piloted functionalities).

Shortlist for Women in Finance UK 2022 announced,Shortlist for Women in Finance UK 2022 announced,"The shortlist for the 2022 edition of the Women in Finance UK competition has been announced.

After two years of virtual events, the Women in Finance Awards will take to the stage to celebrate the outstanding contributions of women to the financial services industry.

For this 6th year, incredible role models will be showcased for their work in 16 categories. More than ever, our judges are looking for individuals, organisations and initiatives that have gone above and beyond, driving change through empowerment and representation, and making a significant impact on businesses, employees and the sector as a whole.

Since its inception, the event has raised awareness of the contribution and success of women in the financial sector while recognising the importance of diversity and inclusion.

The financial sector still has a long way to go to provide more opportunities for women. However, the awards provide a platform and an excellent opportunity to showcase and honour those professional women and companies in their field who are driving the sector forward in ways that are not yet very inclusive.

"How investment and savings platform PiggyVest is changing Nigeria’s youth 
culture","How investment and savings platform PiggyVest is changing Nigeria’s youth 
culture","Odun Eweniyi: Quite a bit of progress has been made in this space since we started PiggyVest six years ago. Nigeria and much of Africa has a savings rate of around 15%. This is really low. But given the proliferation of fintech companies that are opening up access to this space, we can see that the savings rate has actually increased, specifically among young people. Before now, Nigerians would need to have about US$2,000 to take advantage of the most basic investment opportunities. But technology has largely democratised this by allowing people to invest with as little as 20 cents. This means that more people can have access and participate.

Who is your target market?

I don’t think digital innovations should only be developed as solutions to the problems faced by the unbanked. There are groups of people who are considered to be ‘included’ but who aren’t really included because their level of digital literacy and their levels of access aren’t where they should be. This is why I think it’s important to solve this for people who might appear to be included but who don’t know as much or have as much as others. Right now we’re targeting young people with smartphones. For us, this mobile population was the low hanging fruit because they already have bank accounts and they have some financial literacy. We could easily adapt and tailor our products to complement what they’re already using. And as smartphones get cheaper, the market expands, which means that more young people will have access to a device they can use to save for their future.",https://www.cio.com/article/401314/how-investment-and-savings-platform-piggyvest-is-changing-nigerias-youth-culture.html,"While many banks across sub-Saharan Africa have expanded their offerings

"CBA supports Endeavour Energy with landmark $920 Million 
Sustainability-Linked Loan","CBA supports Endeavour Energy with landmark $920 Million 
Sustainability-Linked Loan","Endeavour Energy’s Chief Financial Officer, Francoise Merit, said the SLL supports Endeavour Energy’s commitment to driving enhanced environmental performance and improved sustainability outcomes.

“Endeavour Energy is thrilled to lead the way with the first SLL in our industry. As the electricity network that builds, maintains and supplies power to over 2.6 million people living and working in the some of the fastest growing regions of NSW, we are committed to supporting a greener, renewable and more sustainable energy future,” she said.

The funds raised under the sustainability-linked loan can be used for general corporate purposes, however, the pricing of the loan is tied to the Endeavour Energy achieving a set of agreed sustainability performance targets focused on four areas, including greenhouse gas emissions reduction, landfill waste diversion, net habitat gain and mental health and wellbeing.

“These sustainability performance targets underpin our corporate strategy and are an effective tool for driving sustainability throughout our business as we work towards a net zero future,” Ms Merit concluded.

In setting the greenhouse gas emissions sustainability performance target, Endeavour Energy has committed to achieve a 40 per cent reduction in CO2e Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (excluding line-loss related emissions) by 2030. Line losses account for around 96 per cent of Endeavour Energy’s reportable Scope 2 emissions and are caused by upstream fossil fuel generation outside of the company’s strictly regulated control. Line losses are largely determined by the emissions intensity of the generation mix powering the grid and are also associated with the amount of electricity lost through the transmission and distribution networks.

As part of the SLL, Endeavour Energy has welcomed a ‘gateway’ clause tied to reporting on initiatives that either improve line losses or contribute to the decarbonisation of the grid. These initiatives reflect Endeavour Energy’s increasing role in facilitating and better supporting localised renewable energy generation from its customers through the use of new technologies and markets, including community batteries, allowing customers to store their excess renewable solar generation to be used at times of high losses, localised Distributed Energy Management Systems (DERMS) to optimise the balance of renewables on the system, and digital technology systems to optimise voltages on the network to avoid renewable curtailment.

CBA and ANZ acted as Joint Sustainability Coordinators and Mandated Lead Arrangers, as part of a syndicate of a total 17 banks.

Commonwealth Bank Managing Director, Future Cities and Networks, Michael Thorpe, said Endeavour Energy oversees a piece of energy infrastructure that’s critical to Australia’s transition.

“We commend Endeavour Energy on its commitment to greater transparency around its emissions profile and ambition to reduce its carbon footprint while making its operations more sustainable. Supporting Australia’s decarbonisation journey while ensuring our country’s energy security is a strategic priority for CBA, and we are proud to support Endeavour in its efforts to advance to a net zero future.”",https://www.commbank.com.au/articles/newsroom/2022/03/landmark-sustainability-linked-loan.html,"The Commonwealth Bank has supported Endeavour Energy, via its financing

Top 10 Best Finance Companies In India,Top 10 Best Finance Companies In India,"Top 10 Best Finance Companies In India

In terms of nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP), India is the 6th largest economy on earth, according to data published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Its GDP is estimated to be worth US$ 3.04 trillion and has an annual growth rate of 9.5%. Indian companies doing business overseas and in India complement each other in this regard.

India is a country where every company strives to improve the products or services they provide and customer satisfaction levels. A company’s ranking is determined by a variety of factors, including the company’s revenue, assets, profits, market value, sales, and share price.

Providing credit to buy goods on credit is the speciality of the finance company. Various ventures or projects require loans or credits from finance companies. It is essential for the development of the country that the finance sector grows.

Following the collapse of the global economy in response to COVID-19, finance companies may turn out to be a crucial resource for those who need assistance urgently or those who need to regain momentum quickly. Many startups and small businesses will be looking for assistance.

An organization that offers financial services might be either a bank or a non-banking financial company (NBFC). Examples of the services offered might be mutual funds, housing financing, insurance, debt collection, credit reporting, credit transactions, portfolio management, investment advisory, stockbroking, personal or mortgage loans, etc.

Non-banking financial company NBFC is an entity that offers banking-like financial services without holding a banking license or is subject to banking regulations, as opposed to a bank. NBFCs conduct business in India in the areas of lending, hire-purchase, leasing, insurance, government-issued securities, chits, bonds, acquisition of shares, debentures, and similar securities.

This could be in the form of direct or indirect support, such as the acquisition or building of plots or the renovation of an existing home.

Customers can get a home loan from housing finance providers. As you are aware, the price of real estate is soaring, making it difficult to buy a home without taking out a mortgage. If you want to buy a property, you have several possibilities. You can get a home bank loan or a housing financing company.

Banks and non-banking financial companies both offer home loans (NBFCs). NBFCs include Housing Finance Companies (HFCs). By evaluating the duration, rate of interest, and operational cost offered by each, you can decide whether to go with a bank or an HFC. This could be in the form of direct or indirect support, such as the acquisition or building of plots or the renovation of an existing home.

Banks and non-banking financial companies both offer home loans (NBFCs). NBFCs include Housing Finance Companies (HFCs). By evaluating the duration, rate of interest, and operational cost offered by each, you can decide whether to go with a bank or an HFC. Let’s take a closer look at a few of the country’s best housing finance providers.

Capital One Financial Services is a financial services company. Home loan lenders are divided into four groups.

Bank of the Public Sector Banks in the Private Sector NBFC Affordable Housing Loans are available from banks and non-bank financial institutions.

The first is the Public Sector Bank.

In 2020, SBI, PNB, UNION BANK, INDIAN BANK, and other banks will be the best for home loans.

Bank of the Private Sector In 2020, HDFC, AXIS, ICICI, and IDBI will be the best banks. Non-banking financial institution (NBFI) home loan providers include LIC Housing Finance, PNB Housing Finance, Can Fin Housing Finance, GIC Housing Finance, L&T Housing Finance, and Birla Housing Finance among others. For a Low-Income Housing Loan, AADHAR Housing Finance, Adani Housing Finance, SUBHAM Housing Finance, and others are examples of housing finance companies.

What are non-bank financial companies (NBFCs)?

Non-banking financial companies are referred to as NBFCs. Insurance businesses, large stock brokerage firms, and organizations that fund all types of loans, including those for automobiles, homes, machinery, and even mobile phones, are among them. NBFCs can be defined as organizations that offer a range of banking services without providing basic banking services.

Customers can also make deposits with NBFCs; however, unlike banks, this is in the form of healthcare premiums and publicly traded or privately held shares.

Savings accounts and other deposit programs are not permitted by NBFCs. A primary cooperative organization, for instance, will accept your deposit and issue you shares. As a dividend on your shares, they will pay part of the profits instead of paying interest to your accounts.

Indian citizens have a wide range of needs, which has given rise to more than 250 NBFC (Non-Banking Financial Companies). An NBFC is a financial institution that operates in nine different categories and is the only country in the world to do so.

What are Financial companies?

Finance companies are the ones that lend money to individuals or businesses. They specialize in providing credit for the purchase of products on credit. They provide loans or offer money to individuals for various enterprises or ventures. A bank provides personal loans to organizations and corporations.

Any country’s financial system has a significant impact on its economy, with financial companies having a key part in ensuring strong economic growth. When assessing a company’s financial system, there must be a direct link among authentication mechanisms and regular organizations.

The main distinction between a finance business and a bank would be that the bank takes deposits from publishers but not from the general public. A financial firm, like a bank, serves as a lending institution by extending credit, and it may or may not obtain financing from banks or other sources such as the money market.

This type of business may specialize in working with finance and a variety of instalment plan sales. It provides credit for a variety of purposes, including commercial use, consumer purchases, and the financing of houses and production projects, among others.

Finance companies are quite important in the country. The Indian finance sector is made up of a variety of entities that contribute to India’s economic progress by providing financial aid to various initiatives. Several finance firms operate in India, providing excellent financial services tailored to the demands of customers.

India’s financial market has changed dramatically since liberalization. It is now a vital cog in India’s economic progress. Companies doing business with money are typically banks or companies that aid in the provision of money and services related to individuals and enterprises.

What is the definition of market capitalization?

The company’s market capitalization is calculated using the current valuation and the overall number of share capital. Market capitalization = (current market price of 1 share)* is how it’s determined (total number of outstanding shares)

It aids in the classification of corporations into several sorts, such as large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap. Large-cap stocks have a market capitalization of Rs 28,500 crore or more. Mid-cap companies have a market capitalization of Rs 8,500 crore to Rs 28,500 crore, while small-cap stocks have a market capitalization of less than Rs 8,500 crore.

Household names: 168 Australian companies have paid no tax since 2013,Household names: 168 Australian companies have paid no tax since 2013,"One hundred and sixty-eight of Australia’s biggest companies have paid no tax since 2013 despite reaping profits totalling more than $9.85bn, a Guardian Australia analysis of new data reveals.

They are among companies included in figures released by the Australian Taxation Office on Friday detailing the revenue, profit and tax paid by about 2,300 of the country’s biggest corporations in the 2019-20 financial year.

Previous ATO data dumps cover the period between 2013-14 and 2017-18, making it possible for Guardian Australia to determine which companies contained in the figures have not paid tax over the seven years for which numbers are available.

The companies that paid no tax over the period include household names such as property developer Lendlease and the Australian arms of multinationals including oil and gas major Chevron and German engineering and technology group Bosch.

Reasons why the companies have paid no tax vary. Some, including Lendlease, are part of property trust groups, where paying tax is the responsibility of the investor rather than the company.

Some companies that did not pay any tax, such as subsidiaries of BHP and Rio Tinto, are members of corporate groups where another entity paid their taxes for them.

Others, including Australian Chevron subsidiary Chevron Australia Holdings, have hefty losses run up in previous years that they are able to draw upon to offset their tax payments.

The data also illustrates the rollercoaster ride that Qantas has been on as it swung from a $2.8bn loss in 2013-14 and back into profit. It took until 2017-18 for the flag carrier to eat through its prior year losses and pay some tax – a relatively modest $11m.

In 2018-19 the company paid significantly more, $259m, off the back of taxable income – the tax equivalent of profit – of $942m.

But the coronavirus crisis, which grounded much of the fleet, drove the airline to a $1.9bn loss in 2019-20 and its tax bill back to zero. Qantas lost another $2.35bn in the year just gone, meaning it is unlikely to pay tax for several years to come even as air travel resumes after the pandemic and the company moves back into the black.

Speaking ahead of the release of the most recent set of corporate tax transparency figures, ATO deputy commissioner Rebecca Saint said there were “legitimate reasons why a company may not pay tax”.

“Just because an entity doesn’t pay tax doesn’t necessarily mean that there’s tax avoidance or similar activity occurring. There can be good commercial justification to that,” she said.

“We have high levels of confidence around those entities that don’t pay tax and what I mean by that is we actually go and have looked into whether those losses are generated from commercial activities, as opposed to tax avoidance arrangements.”

One-third, or 782, of the 2,370 companies captured in the 2019-20 data set paid no tax that year.

The data is published under laws introduced when Labor was in power federally and includes the revenue, taxable income and tax paid by public and foreign-owned companies with a turnover of $100m or more and Australian private companies with a turnover of $200m or more.",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/10/household-names-168-australian-companies-have-paid-no-tax-since-2013,"ATO deputy commissioner says there are 'legitimate reasons why a company

What Is Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and How Does It Work?,What Is Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and How Does It Work?,"What Is Decentralized Finance (DeFi)?

Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an emerging financial technology based on secure distributed ledgers similar to those used by cryptocurrencies.

In the U.S., the Federal Reserve and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) define the rules for centralized financial institutions like banks and brokerages, which consumers rely on to access capital and financial services directly. DeFi challenges this centralized financial system by empowering individuals with peer-to-peer transactions.

Key Takeaways Decentralized finance, or DeFi, uses emerging technology to remove third parties and centralized institutions from financial transactions.

The components of DeFi are cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, and software that allow people to transact financially with each other.

DeFi is still in its infancy and subject to hacks and thefts because of sloppy programming and a lack of security testing before applications are launched.

Investopedia / Joules Garcia

How Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Works

Through peer-to-peer financial networks, DeFi uses security protocols, connectivity, software, and hardware advancements. This system eliminates intermediaries like banks and other financial service companies. These companies charge businesses and customers for using their services, which are necessary in the current system because it's the only way to make it work. DeFi uses blockchain technology to reduce the need for these intermediaries.

Blockchain

A blockchain is a distributed and secured database or ledger. In the blockchain, transactions are recorded in blocks and verified through automated processes. If a transaction is verified, the block is closed and encrypted; another block is created with information about the previous block, along with information about newer transactions.

The blocks are ""chained"" together through the information in each proceeding block, giving it the name blockchain. Information in previous blocks cannot be changed without affecting the following blocks, so there is no way to alter a blockchain. This concept, along with other security protocols, provides the secure nature of a blockchain.

Using applications called wallets that can send information to a blockchain, individuals hold private keys to tokens or cryptocurrencies that act like passwords. These keys give them access to virtual tokens that represent value. Ownership of the tokens is transferred by 'sending' an amount to another entity via a wallet, whose wallet, in turn, generates a different private key for them. This secures their ownership of the token, and the blockchain design prevents the transfer from being reversed.

Applications

DeFi applications are designed to communicate with a blockchain, allowing people to use their money for purchases, loans, gifts, trading, or any other way they want without a third party. These applications are programs installed on a device like a personal computer, tablet, or smartphone that make it easier to use. Without the applications, DeFi would still exist, but users would need to be comfortable and familiar with using the command line or terminal in the operating system that runs their device.

DeFi applications provide an interface that automates transactions between users by giving them financial options to choose from. For example, if you want to make a loan to someone and charge them interest, you can select the option on the interface and enter terms like interest or collateral. If you need a loan, you can search for providers, which could range from a bank to an individual who could lend you some cryptocurrency after you agree on terms.

Some applications let you enter parameters for the services you're looking for and match you with another user. Because the blockchain is a global network, you could give or receive financial services to or from anywhere in the world.

Decentralized finance does not provide full anonymity. Transactions do not include an individual's name but are traceable by anyone with the knowledge to do so. This includes governments and law enforcement, which, at times, are necessary for protecting an individual's financial interests.

Goals of Decentralized Finance

Peer-to-peer (P2P) financial transactions are one of the core premises behind DeFi, where two parties agree to exchange cryptocurrency for goods or services without a third party involved.

Using DeFi allows for:

Accessibility : Anyone with an internet connection can access a DeFi platform, and transactions occur without geographic restrictions.

: Anyone with an internet connection can access a DeFi platform, and transactions occur without geographic restrictions. Low fees and high interest rates : DeFi enables any two parties to negotiate interest rates directly and lend cryptocurrency or money via DeFi networks.

: DeFi enables any two parties to negotiate interest rates directly and lend cryptocurrency or money via DeFi networks. Security and Transparency : Smart contracts published on a blockchain and records of completed transactions are available for anyone to review but do not reveal your identity. Blockchains are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed.

: Smart contracts published on a blockchain and records of completed transactions are available for anyone to review but do not reveal your identity. Blockchains are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed. Autonomy: DeFi platforms don't rely on centralized financial institutions. The decentralized nature of DeFi protocols mitigates the need for and costs of administering financial services.

Peer-to-peer lending under DeFi doesn't mean there won't be any interest and fees. However, it does mean that you'll have many more options since the lender can be anywhere in the world.

What Is an Example of DeFi?

DeFi is an all-inclusive term for any application that uses blockchain and cryptocurrency techniques or technology to offer financial services. Some of these applications can provide anything from basic services like savings accounts to more advances services like providing liquidity to businesses or investors. One of the more notable DeFi service providers is Aave, which is a ""decentralized non-custodial liquidity market protocol"" that allows anyone to participate as a liquidity supplier or borrower.

Aave lets you stake any of your crypto-assets to earn interest income from users who might borrow your assets.

Decentralized Finance Uses

Decentralized finance, originally conceived of as a way to bring financial services like loans and banking to those who don't have access to them, has morphed into an industry where you can take part in many different sectors or endeavors. Here are a few of the most popular:

Decentralized exchanges : The top preference for defi app users is accessing decentralized exchanges. Exchanges like Uniswap and PancakeSwap have apps that let you interact with other cryptocurrency users.

Liquidity providers : Liquidity is the ability to sell assets quickly, a problem many cryptocurrency users have encountered. Liquidity providers are generally pools where users place funds so exchanges can provide selling opportunities for their users.

Liquidity providers are generally pools where users place funds so exchanges can provide selling opportunities for their users. Lending/Yield Farming: There are hundreds of defi apps available that provide lending. Generally, they operate the same way as a liquidity pool, where users lock their funds in a pool and let others borrow them, receiving interest on their loans—called yield farming. Many provide flash loans, where no collateral is required from the borrower.

NFTs: The market for non-fungible tokens has cooled somewhat, but they are still popular with niche investors and collectors.

How to Get Involved in DeFi

Becoming involved in decentralized finance might seem intimidating at first, but there are many ways to do so. The first thing you should do if you want to get into DeFi is to research the activities that interest you the most. You'll need a wallet, but because there are so many to choose from, you'll need to learn more about them and find the one that appeals to you.

Once you identify your wallet and activity, you can find a reputable exchange that provides the activity you want to get involved in or use, buy some cryptocurrency, and get started.



Concerns About DeFi

Decentralized finance is constantly evolving. It is unregulated, and its ecosystem is vulnerable to faulty programming, hacks, and scams. For example, one of the main ways hackers and thieves steal cryptocurrency is through weaknesses in DeFi applications.

Laws have not yet caught up with advances in technology. Most current laws were crafted based on the idea of separate financial jurisdictions, each with its own set of laws and rules. DeFi’s borderless transaction ability presents essential questions for this type of regulation. For example:

Who is responsible for investigating a financial crime that occurs across borders, protocols, and DeFi apps?

Who would enforce the regulations?

How would they enforce them?

DeFi Hype

Just like other blockchain- and cryptocurrency-related projects, businesses, and activities, decentralized finance is subject to considerable hype and misinformation, hoping to attract users and their money. Cryptocurrency, blockchain, and all technologies associated with them are also subject to extreme price volatility.



Lots of Money in Crypto, But Not as Much as You'd Think

There is a considerable amount of money flowing through cryptocurrency exchanges, but it isn't nearly as much as you might be led to believe. Most people still use the traditional financial systems we are all used to. For example, only 0.56% of all money is tied up in cryptocurrency and decentralized finance—a very small figure that should encourage you to do your research to learn if using or investing in DeFi apps, platforms, and cryptocurrency is worth it.

Crypto Winters

A crypto-winter is a period where crypto prices continuously move down and then stay down—sometimes tens of thousands of dollars. The last one occurred between 2022 and 2023. Prices had been rising significantly before 2022 as investors turned to anything they could find following the initial outbreak of COVID-19 and the ensuing pandemic. During that time, they discovered Bitcoin was not only holding value; it was increasing as well—but this was most likely due to their own self-fulfilling prophecies and hype as they drove the price increases themselves.

But toward the end of 2022, prices began declining and stayed there. Billions of dollars were lost during this time. During this period, there were no rumors of substance or any regulatory developments (in the U.S.) beyond a perceived campaign of persecution orchestrated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, when rumors began circulating about a Spot Bitcoin ETF approval in October 2023, the hyping began again, and prices rose. When the approval of 11 Bitcoin Spot ETFs was announced in January 2024, prices climbed steadily for a few months (supposedly ending the winter) until a sideways market emerged yet again in March 2024.

Is It Worth It?

DeFi might be just what you're looking for regarding your finances. However, it might not—the decentralized finance industry is still in its infancy and evolving, making it somewhat of a gamble for most people.

The low amount of actual money invested in cryptocurrency and the effects that hype has on prices should make you consider whether investing in decentralized finance is worth it. If you have money you can afford to lose, the space can be very profitable—but the amount of losses can be just as significant.

If you don't have money to lose and are looking for ways to fund your retirement or grow your portfolio or net worth over time, defi and cryptocurrency should be the last investment you should consider. They are still too new and volatile to risk your future on.

What Does Decentralized Finance Do? The goal of DeFi is to challenge the use of centralized financial institutions and third parties involved in all financial transactions.

Is Bitcoin Part of Decentralized Finance? Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency. DeFi is designed to use cryptocurrency in its ecosystem, so Bitcoin isn't DeFi as much as it is a part of it.

What Is Total Value Locked in DeFi? Total value locked (TVL) is the sum of all cryptocurrencies staked, loaned, deposited in a pool, or used for other financial actions across all of DeFi. It can also represent the sum of specific cryptocurrencies used for financial activities, such as ether or bitcoin.

Is DeFi a Good Investment? Investing in DeFi involves purchasing a cryptocurrency that is used in DeFi and is susceptible to hacks. DeFi hacking has been an issue for several years, but according to the blockchain analysts at Chainalysis, the trend dropped significantly in 2023. However, this doesn't mean it won't pick back up again. Like all cryptocurrency and blockchain investments, there are significant risks involved.

The Bottom Line

Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an emerging financial technology that challenges the current centralized banking system. DeFi attempts to eliminate the fees banks and other financial service companies charge while promoting peer-to-peer transactions.

DeFi, like the blockchains and cryptocurrencies it supports, is still in its infancy. Significant hurdles must be overcome before it can replace the existing financial system, which has its own issues that are difficult to resolve. Lastly, financial service companies and banks are not going to be replaced without a fight—if there is a way for them to profit from the transition to a blockchain-based financial system, they will find it and make sure they are part of it.",https://www.investopedia.com/decentralized-finance-defi-5113835,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) refers to blockchain-connected platforms and

Celltel Networks settles on local finance company in $500m deal,Celltel Networks settles on local finance company in $500m deal,"Celltel Networks Limited, Ghanaian Technology Company, has appointed local finance company, Ed & Co Capital Limited as financial advisors for the $500 million Ghana Smart Cities project.

A memorandum of understanding to that effect was signed between the two companies in Accra with the Founder and Executive Chairman of Celltel Networks, Dr Prince Kofi Kludjeson and Chief Executive of Ed and Co, Emmanuel Dabi, initialing the agreement.

As part of the deal, Ed & Co would arrange and manage the relationship between various institutions or individuals and the banks that would underwrite the subscriptions on clients’ behalf.

The Ghana Smart Cities project, designed to provide affordable nationwide Wi-Fi network in collaboration with the local government institutions and other strategic and relevant government agencies, is scheduled to begin in the second quarter of next year.

The Celtell Chairman said it would provide affordable Apple handheld devices, laptops on subscription and flexible payment terms to enable many more Ghanaians to own Apple devices and pay in instalments.

“Beyond the Apple devices, we will also distribute digital television sets that make access to the internet at home easy – this one also comes on a subscription basis,” he added.

He explained that every level of subscription would come with one device or the other and the vision is to enable access to education, health, security, business and other relevant materials on the internet in the comfort of homes, offices, school and more.

Celltel and its partners, including Cisco, Hughes Corporation, Apple, and some local broadband spectrum licensees are currently funding the installation of the nationwide Wi-Fi infrastructure and provision of affordab le smart devices to customers across the country.

Dr Kludjeson said Celltel had already made contacts with various institutions, including the Ghana National Association of Teachers, to provide KQ branded handheld smart devices as well as laptops and smart televisions on monthly subscription basis.

He said the company has already recruited several young Ghanaian professionals who have been working with partners abroad to establish a reliable network and build custom-made solutions for various categories of subscribers.

“We are also at the finishing stages of an assembling plant within the Free Zones enclave at Tema to ensure local assembling of affordable devices sooner than later – this will provide jobs for several young Ghanaians,” he said.

The Celltel Founder said the project would provide opportunities for many several young entrepreneurs who will be the main agents in the various districts and get to share in the wealth that will be created locally.

“We are going to bring everybody else on board in the consortium so that we can empower everybody so that the 275 constituencies can be covered and be funded through the off taker agreement,” he said.

Celltel Networks believes in the government’s Digital Ghana Agenda, characterised by paperless services at all government offices, digital address systems, and various electronic services such as e-education, e-health, e-agriculture and many more.

The Executive of Ed and Co said they were already in talks with several banks and Finance organisations who have expressed interest in underwriting subscriptions for prospective customers.

“We are so delighted to be appointed as the transaction advisors of the ICT Company Celltel Network and hope that we all put our hands on deck we will try as much as possible and get this particular fund that is the $500 million for the project well structured,” he said.

“We will make sure that this smart city concept of Celltel Company will come to fruition.”

Exposing the financial network behind Hemedti's RSF in Sudan,Exposing the financial network behind Hemedti's RSF in Sudan,"The Al Gunade gold company is owned by three members of the Daglo family: Hemedti’s brother, Abdul Rahim Hamdan Daglo, and Abdul Rahim’s two young sons, while according to the document, Hemedti himself is on the Board of Directors.

When approached by Global Witness a spokesperson for Al Gunade said that Hemedti had ended his formal role in the company in 2009, and that the corporate document hadn’t been updated. The spokesperson denied that Al Gunade provides any financial support to the RSF but did confirm commercial ties between the company and the RSF. He claimed that certain money movements between Al Gunade and would have related to commercial transactions.

Al Gunade and the RSF appear to be deeply intertwined. Al Gunade’s owner, Abdul Rahim Daglo, is widely reported to be the deputy head of the RSF. A Sudanese Ministry of Minerals press release describes a ministerial visit to Jabel Amer, by invitation of Lieutenant Brigadier Abdul Rahim Hamdan Daglo. In former President al-Bashir’s corruption trial Abdul Rahim Hamdan Daglo was said, by President Bashir’s former office manager, to have received five million euros from the former Sudanese dictator, who handed over the funds in the presence of Hemedti.

Abdul Rahim is also alleged to be partly responsible for the 3rd June massacre. The BBC reported an interview with an anonymous RSF officer that an Abdul Rahim Daglo gave the order to clear the Khartoum sit-in – although the BBC was unable to independently corroborate this claim.

A leaked RSF spreadsheet shared with Global Witness by the Sudanese Al Bashoum Facebook page also suggests close links between Al Gunade and the RSF. The RSF seemingly recorded paying 686,000 Dirham (US $186,000) to wire to an individual for payments to China with a reference to Al Gunade in the same spreadsheet line. Another line of the spreadsheet lists a 50,000 Dirham (US $14,000) payment apparently for the debts of Al-Gunade.

These payments suggest a financial link between the company and the paramilitary group. Evidence of the payments are also interesting in the context of independent reports from Sudanese businesspeople with knowledge of the situation, that the Al Gunade company was in debt in the months leading up to and following the ousting of Bashir – the same financial period covered by the spreadsheet.

In response to a separate investigation by Reuters, the company’s General Manager denied any link to the RSF, reportedly saying “Algunade is as far as can be from the RSF.”

Al-Gunade has expanded in recent years, perhaps in part due to its apparent relationship with the RSF. The RSF famously took control over the large Jebel Amer gold mining area in Darfur by force in November 2017. A map from the state-owned Sudanese Mineral Resources Company shows that Al Gunade has the only large concession operational in Darfur, in the vicinity of Jebel Amer. The region has some the largest mineral and gold reserves in the country, according to the Ministry of Minerals.

Al Gunade now operates well beyond Darfur. In addition to Al Gunade’s office in Khartoum the SMRC mining registry lists the firm as active in South Kordofan, while interviews with traders indicate their presence in the northern Sudanese gold markets of Abu Hamad and Alabidia.

Recently, according to Sudanese media organisation Radio Dabanga, protests by local people in the town of Talodi, South Kordofan against the excessive use of mercury contamination around Al Gunade mine sites led to a heavy handed response from the RSF, who arrived in Toyota Hilux and Land Cruiser vehicles, reportedly injuring civilian protestors in the ensuing clashes.

In sum, the RSF and a connected company have captured a swathe of the country’s gold industry and are likely using it to fund their operations.

RSF VEHICLES AT RISK OF BEING USED IN HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES WERE BOUGHT IN DUBAI

While the documents discussed above detail some of the sources of the RSF’s economic power, another leaked document sheds light on their military power. This power partly derives from their use of highly mobile units of ‘technicals’ – armed desert vehicles converted from civilian use by welding mounted machine guns on to the back of pick-up trucks.

The leaked RSF spreadsheet seemingly describes how the militia received over 150mn Dirham (US $40 million) ‘for technical support’ from an unknown source, and used over 111mn Dirham (US $30 million) of that to purchase vehicles and communications equipment.

The document suggests that the RSF bought over 1,000 vehicles during the first six months of 2019, from dealers in the UAE. The shipments included over 900 Toyota Hilux and Land Cruisers, models which the RSF frequently converts into ‘technicals’ – 4x4 military vehicles mounted with machine guns.

The spreadsheet helps builds a picture of how the RSF have become Sudan’s most powerful military force. There is no suggestion that Toyota were aware of the use to which these vehicles have been put at the time of their purchase.

THE SPREADSHEET ALSO REVEALS ANOTHER PROBABLE RSF FRONT COMPANY – GSK

One payment made by the RSF is described in the spreadsheet as being made on behalf of GSK Advance, an information technology and security company run by Hemedti’s younger brother Algoney Hamdan Daglo.

According to the spreadsheet several payments were made by the RSF to (or on behalf of) Algoney directly, or to a network of Algoney’s friends and acquaintances who are named in an archived copy of the GSK website as GSK staff members. Some of the line items specify that payments are made by these middlemen on behalf of the RSF (rather than another entity) as part of its procurement activities overseas. Despite repeated contacts, neither GSK, nor Algoney Hamdan Daglo or the middlemen named in the RSF spreadsheet have commented on allegations put to them by Global Witness.

In total, the RSF seems to have paid over 9 million dirhams (US $2.5million) to companies overseas via a network of procurement agents in countries including the UAE, Rwanda, Malaysia and China. Individuals within the network also made visits to Germany, Russia, and the Netherlands, countries to which the spreadsheet shows substantial transfers.

CONCLUSION

Exposing the workings of the RSF’s financial network is a crucial step towards combatting their economic power. If Sudan is to pursue a peaceful democratic transition, it is crucial to ensure civilian oversight of the military spending, and to give the Sudanese people greater control of their own natural resources — that at the moment are dominated by RSF and other security forces within Sudan.

Hemedti sits at the apex of a ‘paramilitary-industrial complex’. He controls both a large powerful military force, and an independent source of wealth. Unless he is removed from this dual position, and all military forces are brought under civilian strategic and financial control, he is an obstacle to the transition to civilian and democratic government that many in Sudan yearn for.

Sequoia Financial Group (ASX:SEQ) FY18 results,Sequoia Financial Group (ASX:SEQ) FY18 results,"(ASX:SEQ)

Welcome to the Finance News Network, I'm Jessica Amir. Today I'm with Sequoia Financial Group LimitedCEO and Managing Director Scott Beeton.Hi Scott and welcome back.Thanks Jessica, thanks for having me.So for those who aren't familiar, you're an integrated financial services firm with over AUD$3 billion in funds under advice. Just give us a quick introduction.Thanks Jessica, you're right. Sequoia Financial Group Limitedis an integrated financial service firm. We've divided our business into four main divisions and they centre around the accountant, the financial planner, stock broker and the mortgage broker. Under those four divisions, our main emphasis at the moment is mainly financial planning. Finding financing solutions to over 250 financial planners. And also to the stock broking sector, where we provide stock broking services to many financial planners, accountants, and also to the self-directed investor.Thanks Scott. Now to your FY18 results well done. But just tell us some of the highlights.FY18 was a fantastic year for all of Sequoia Financial Group Limited. We had record revenue and record profitability across all our divisions in the group. Our revenue was in excess of AUD$76 million. Our Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) was AUD$4.3 million and our Net Profit After Tax (NPAT) was AUD$2.4 million for the year.And what drove those results, Scott?Well FY18, the good news for Sequoia Financial Group Limited is most of our growth came from organic growth. And that was across every division with record revenue and underlining profitability in each division. But also we have a strategy of acquisition and in the year we were successful in acquiring Morrison Securities Pty Ltd and InterpracGroup Pty Ltd.Thanks Scott. Now let's talk about your capital raise. You've raised AUD$5 million. Tell us who got behind the raise and what you're planning to use the funds for.For the AUD$5 million, we've actually required that for our reg cap (regulatory capital) requirements under our stock broking division. So, I said earlier we acquired Morrison Securities Pty Ltd. Throughout the year we’ve been rebuilding that business for our core activities. Providing stock broking services to financial planners and other stock brokers in the industry.So that AUD$5 million was raised for ‘reg cap’ that we needed to put behind that business so we could actually integrate our other stock broking business, D2MX Pty Ltd into it. The good news is that's all completed. And we're expected to have savings of AUD$500,000 this coming financial year.Wonderful. Now let's talk about your strategy Scott. Where you at?FY18 we acquired a couple of businesses. The main one was Morrison Securities Pty Ltd and InterpracGroup Pty Ltd. We also purchased the extra shares we didn’t own in FNN, which is Finance News Network and also the InterpracGroup Pty Ltd general insurance business. We acquired another 10 per cent of that. We bought an accounting practice called My Own Super Fund Pty Ltd. So we did plenty of acquisitions in FY18 and where we are at right now is just building off those foundations and we've really focused on organic growth. But also bedding down those acquisitions. And also integrating them across all the business units together.You've been very busy indeed. And lastly, is there anything that you wanted to add?Well as you said, FY18 was a very big year for Sequoia Financial Group. We've got great foundations now for moving forward with great underlying businesses. We're scaling them up in every way we can, and the amount of organic growth in the market place is just unbelievable for us, and we're looking forward to another great FY19 year.Wonderful.

India’s Top 50 NBFCs Ranking | NBFC in India,India’s Top 50 NBFCs Ranking,"For the first time, The Banking and Finance Post, Asia and Middle East’s premier magazine has come up with the ranking of India’s top 50 Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs). The “India’s Top 50 NBFCs Ranking 2017” has been introduced with an aim to provide useful insights into this important segment of the economy, which is being streamlined to fund the unfunded.

NBFCs play a critical role in the Indian financial system. They provide services such as personal loans, housing loans, gold loans, insurance and loans for purchasing commercial vehicles, machinery, and farm equipment, among others. The ability of NBFCs to understand their customer profile, their credit portfolio and deliver customised products and services are driving their fast growth in India.

NBFCs are also crucial for achieving the ‘Financial Inclusion’ goals by offering lending services to the unbanked population in rural, semi-rural or few urban areas. These are also important source of financial services for the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) – the backbone of an economy like ours.

The experience of NBFCs in understanding the customers’ profile and analysing their credit needs has been invaluable. Moreover, like most of the other segments of India’s financial sector, NBFCs too are transforming rapidly by using digital technology to improve customer interface.

A recent report by the Microfinance Institutions Network focused on adoption of ‘cash-lite’ models among MFIs in the country revealed that over 60 per cent of the NBFC-MFIs have adopted cashless methods to disburse money.

All this guided us to carry out an objective ranking of NBFCs in the country. Through our methodologies, we have tried to break the barriers of demography. Our rankings, as you will find, are spread across the length and breadth of the country and not limited to the metros and big cities alone. It is hoped that the ranking will be equally beneficial for NBFCs and those touched by them.

Ranking Methodology:

“India’s Top 50 NBFCs Ranking 2017” was carried out on the basis of three parameters: Annual turnover, social media engagement and customer satisfaction. As is evident by the name, under the annual turnover parameter, Non-banking financial companies were ranked based on their yearly turnover. Under the other two parameters – social engagement and customer satisfaction – the NBFCs were ranked on the basis of the result of our survey and the perception score.

Top 50 NBFCs ranking is a unique benchmark. Based on the scores secured by the NBFCs under the parameters, the cumulative score of all the institutions was calculated. The NBFC with highest cumulative score was ranked first, while the institution with lowest score was ranked last.

Ranking Parameter

Annual Turnover

Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) are fast emerging as an alternative to mainstream banking. They are playing an integral part in the Indian Financial System and have immense potential to take forward the Central Government’s agenda of financial inclusion.

Their contribution to the economy has grown exponentially over the years. As a matter of fact, the growth of NBFCs is not just driven by traditional products like commercial vehicle financing, but also financial products like personal and housing loans, etc.

The growth of the sector is accredited to cost efficiency, bad debt control, customised products and better customer services. In terms of annual turnover for financial year 2016-17, NBFCs have scripted a great success story. The financial assets of NBFCs have recorded a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19 per cent over the past few years, comprising 13 per cent of the total credit which is expected to reach nearly 18 per cent by 2018-19.

Keeping the continual growth of NBFCs in mind, India’s Top 50 NBFCs Ranking 2017 considered the annual turnover as one of the parameters in judging their level of excellence.

Customer Satisfaction

Banking operations are increasingly becoming customer dictated. As far as Indian finance sector is concerned, financial institutions offering one-stop integrated financial services are on the rise. There is an intense competition in the market to gain customers. Therefore, the leaders in Indian banking domain are not only competing with each on the price factor, but also how their customers feel about their services.

Realising the customer satisfaction as the most important factor to become a business leader, all Non-banking financial companies are focusing more on better services, improved financial plans for customers and more engagement with their clients. Perceptionbased ranking under this parameter helped us determine how satisfied the customers are with NBFCs’ services

Customer Value Improved Service Quality:

In the current economic scenario, NBFCs are rendering efficient services to gain competitive advantage and, thereby, enhancing their customer relationship. The NBFCs are emphasising more on creating loyal customers by customising their services to serve their customers better as per their needs. This in turn is expected to pave the way for achieving greater customer satisfaction to a larger extent.

In the era of ICT (Information, Communication and Technology), the mode of direct pay, online financial services have gained value which leads to flexible hours of operation as per customers’ needs. Increased market competition is resulting into higher defection rates of customers.

Thus, research on service quality and satisfaction of customers in finance sector is considered important.

Handling Customer Expectations:

Meeting customer expectations plays a central role resulting into higher satisfaction ratings for any service provided by NBFCs. However, the NBFCs also have to handle negative perception about their services and have to constantly make improvements to keep their customers satisfied. At the same time, it is also true that the nonbanking institutions can improve their ratings where customers have positive preconceptions and high expectations for the services.

Social Media Engagement

In this digital era and consumption of information on the move, social media is playing a key role in social engagement not only in terms of communication with clients but also in building a brand value in the targeted domain.

Today, people and organisations remain connected and updated through various social media networks like Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin and others. The perception-based ranking under this parameter helped us determine how well Non-banking financial companies are socially engaged with their customers.

Digital assets across web, mobility and social media is also assisting nonbanking institutions to build customer advocacy and customer-centricity approach. Being an integral player in the financial segment, NBFCs, like their banking counterparts, are making optimum utilisation of social media in reaching out to their customers.

Connectivity: Social engagements through different social media channels help NBFCs enhance their connectivity with customers. As the target customers of NBFCs mainly are Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), social media proves to be an excellent platform for them to connect with these enterprises. Moreover, various social media channels can also be used constantly by NBFCs for communicating with their clients by promoting and sharing relevant information.

Community Building: Social engagement is a great way to reach out to potential customers and enterprises. The community thus formed helps Non-banking financial companies to showcase their products and services even in remote locations of the country.

Stimulate Knowledge: Social media networks have wide reach and NBFCs are using these networks to keep their target audience updated. NBFCs also use social media as an opportunity to effectively fill knowledge gaps by sharing relevant information. Having an online presence helps strengthen connectivity without any limitations on proximity.

"American Express Card (AmEx Card): Definition, Types, and Fees","American Express Card (AmEx Card): Definition, Types, and Fees","What Is an American Express Card?

An American Express card, also known as an “Amex” card, is an electronic payment card branded by the publicly traded financial services company American Express (AXP). The company issues and processes prepaid, charge, and credit cards. American Express cards are available to individuals, small businesses, and corporate consumers across the United States and around the world.

Key Takeaways American Express cards are issued by American Express—a publicly traded financial services company—and are charge cards, credit cards, or prepaid cards.

An American Express card, also called an “Amex” card, can offer a variety of perks, including rewards points, cash back, and travel perks. Some cards are co-branded, such as those with Delta and Hilton.

American Express is one of the few companies that issues cards and has a network to process card payments. Visa and Mastercard have processing networks but don’t issue cards.

Understanding American Express Cards

American Express cards are issued by American Express and processed on the American Express network. American Express is one of only a few financial service companies in the industry that has the capability to both issue and process electronic payment cards.

American Express is a publicly traded company in the financial services industry. It offers both credit lending and network processing services, giving it a broad range of competitors in the industry. As with traditional lenders, it has the capability to issue credit products, which it provides in the form of charge cards and credit cards.

American Express has its own processing network that competes with Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V). Its most comparable competitor is Discover Financial Services (DFS), which is also a publicly traded financial service company offering both credit lending and a processing service network. With multiproduct capabilities, American Express generates revenue from both interest-earning products and network processing transaction services.

The term “Black Card” refers to the American Express Centurion card, which is offered by invitation only.

American Express Fees

American Express generates a significant portion of its revenue from transaction processing. Many merchants accept American Express cards and are willing to pay the transaction fees associated with processing because of the advantages that come with offering American Express as a payment option to customers.

In an American Express transaction, the merchant’s acquiring bank communicates with American Express as both the processor and the issuing bank in the transaction process. Merchant acquiring banks must work with the American Express processing network to transmit communications in American Express transactions. American Express is also the issuer that authenticates and approves the transaction.

Merchants pay a small fee to American Express for its processing network services, which are part of the comprehensive fees involved with a single transaction. As both a processor and high-quality lender, American Express has built a strong reputation in the financial services industry.

Types of American Express Cards

As noted above, American Express credit cards and prepaid debit cards are offered to a variety of both retail and commercial customers. It is also an industry-leading provider of charge cards, which offer month-to-month credit with card balances that must be paid off each month.

American Express charge and credit cards follow standard underwriting procedures. The company seeks good- to high-credit quality borrowers—which means a credit score of at least 670—and generally is not a subprime lender.

American Express credit and charge cards come with a variety of benefits in the form of rewards points and travel perks, which depend, in part, on the annual fee charged. American Express cards may offer cash back on certain purchases, though they aren’t among the best cash back cards currently available. American Express also offers numerous branded prepaid debit cards, which can be used as gift cards or special-purpose reloadable payment cards.

Annual fees for American Express cards tend to run high: $95 for the Blue Cash Preferred Card, $99 for the Delta SkyMiles Gold American Express Card, $150 for the Green Card, $250 for the Gold Card, and $550 for the Platinum Card. That said, the Green, Gold, and Platinum cards have no predetermined spending limits. American Express does offer at least six cards with no annual fee. Customer service for all Amex cards is highly rated, with the company coming in No. 1 on J.D. Power’s 2020 U.S. Credit Card Satisfaction Study.

Partnerships, co-branded cards

American Express issues many of its cards directly to consumers, but it also has partnerships with other financial institutions. In the U.S., for example, Wells Fargo issued an American Express card (new applications were paused in April 2021, although this doesn’t affect current cardholders), and in Mexico, Banco Santander offers American Express cards. American Express also has partnerships with other companies to encourage consumers to apply for its credit cards. Two examples are its co-branded cards with Delta Air Lines, which allow consumers to earn frequent flier miles redeemable on Delta, and its Hilton Hotels co-branded cards.

Financial Technology (Fintech): Its Uses and Impact on Our Lives,Financial Technology (Fintech): Its Uses and Impact on Our Lives,"What Is Financial Technology (Fintech)?

Financial technology (better known as fintech) is used to describe new technology that seeks to improve and automate the delivery and use of financial services. ​​​At its core, fintech is utilized to help companies, business owners, and consumers better manage their financial operations, processes, and lives. It is composed of specialized software and algorithms that are used on computers and smartphones. Fintech, the word, is a shortened combination of “financial technology.”

When fintech emerged in the 21st century, the term was initially applied to the technology employed at the backend systems of established financial institutions, such as banks. From 2018 or so to 2022, there was a shift to consumer-oriented services. Fintech now includes different sectors and industries such as education, retail banking, fundraising and nonprofit, and investment management, to name a few.

Fintech also includes the development and use of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin. While that segment of fintech may see the most headlines, the big money still lies in the traditional global banking industry and its multitrillion-dollar market capitalization.

Key Takeaways Fintech refers to the integration of technology into offerings by financial services companies to improve their use and delivery to consumers.

It primarily works by unbundling offerings by such firms and creating new markets for them.

Companies in the finance industry that use fintech have expanded financial inclusion and use technology to cut down on operational costs.

Fintech funding is on the rise, but regulatory problems exist.

Examples of fintech applications include robo-advisors, payment apps, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending apps, investment apps, and crypto apps, among others.

Understanding Fintech

Broadly, the term “financial technology” can apply to any innovation in how people transact business, from the invention of digital money to double-entry bookkeeping. Since the internet revolution, financial technology has grown explosively.

You likely use some element of fintech on a daily basis. Some examples include transferring money from your debit account to your checking account via your iPhone, sending money to a friend through Venmo, or managing investments through an online broker. According to EY’s 2019 Global FinTech Adoption Index, two-thirds of consumers utilize at least two or more fintech services, and those consumers are increasingly aware of fintech as a part of their daily lives.

Fintech in Practice

The most talked-about (and most funded) fintech startups share the same characteristic: They are designed to challenge, and eventually take over, traditional financial services providers by being more nimble, serving an underserved segment of the population, or providing faster or better service.

For example, financial company Affirm seeks to cut credit card companies out of the online shopping process by offering a way for consumers to secure immediate, short-term loans for purchases. While rates can be high, Affirm claims to offer a way for consumers with poor or no credit a way to secure credit and build their credit history.

Similarly, Better Mortgage seeks to streamline the home mortgage process with a digital-only offering that can reward users with a verified pre-approval letter within 24 hours of applying. GreenSky seeks to link home improvement borrowers with banks by helping consumers avoid lenders and save on interest by offering zero-interest promotional periods.

For consumers with poor or no credit, Tala offers consumers in the developing world microloans by doing a deep data dig on their smartphones for their transaction history and seemingly unrelated things, such as what mobile games they play. Tala seeks to give such consumers better options than local banks, unregulated lenders, and other microfinance institutions.

In short, if you have ever wondered why some aspect of your financial life was so unpleasant (such as applying for a mortgage with a traditional lender) or felt like it wasn’t quite the right fit, fintech probably has (or seeks to have) a solution for you.

Fintech’s Expanding Horizons

In its most basic form, fintech unbundles financial services into individual offerings that are often easier to use. The combination of streamlined offerings with technology allows fintech companies to be more efficient and cut down on costs associated with each transaction.

If one word can describe how many fintech innovations have affected traditional trading, banking, financial advice, and products, it’s “disruption”—a word you have likely heard in commonplace conversations or the media. Financial products and services that were once the realm of branches, salespeople, and desktops are now more commonly found on mobile devices.

For example, the mobile-only stock trading app Robinhood charges no fees for trades, and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending sites like Prosper Marketplace, LendingClub, and OnDeck promise to reduce rates by opening up competition for loans to broad market forces. Business loan providers such as Kabbage, Lendio, Accion, and Funding Circle (among others) offer startup and established businesses easy, fast platforms to secure working capital. Oscar, an online insurance startup, received $165 million in funding in March 2018. Such significant funding rounds are not unusual and occur globally for fintech startups.

This shift to a digital-first mindset has pushed several traditional institutions to invest heavily in similar products. For example, investment bank Goldman Sachs launched consumer lending platform Marcus in 2016 in an effort to enter the fintech space.

That said, many tech-savvy industry watchers warn that keeping apace of fintech-inspired innovations requires more than just ramped-up tech spending. Rather, competing with lighter-on-their-feet startups requires a significant change in thinking, processes, decision making, and even overall corporate structure.

Fintech and New Technologies

New technologies, such as machine learning/artificial intelligence (AI), predictive behavioral analytics, and data-driven marketing, will take the guesswork and habit out of financial decisions. “Learning” apps will not only learn the habits of users but also engage users in learning games to make their automatic, unconscious spending and saving decisions better.

Fintech is also a keen adapter of automated customer service technology, utilizing chatbots and AI interfaces to assist customers with basic tasks and keep down staffing costs. Fintech is also being leveraged to fight fraud by leveraging information about payment history to flag transactions that are outside the norm.

Fintech Landscape

Since the mid-2010s, fintech has exploded, with startups receiving billions in venture funding (some of which have become unicorns) and incumbent financial firms either snatching up new ventures or building out their own fintech offerings.

North America still produces most of the fintech startups, with Asia a relatively close second, followed by Europe. Some of the most active areas of fintech innovation include or revolve around the following areas (among others):

Cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.), digital tokens (e.g., non-fungible tokens, or NFTs), and digital cash. These often rely on blockchain technology, which is a distributed ledger technology (DLT) that maintains records on a network of computers but has no central ledger. Blockchain also allows for so-called smart contracts, which utilize code to automatically execute contracts between parties such as buyers and sellers.

Open banking, which is a concept that proposes that all people should have access to bank data to build applications that create a connected network of financial institutions and third-party providers. An example is the all-in-one money management tool Mint.

Insurtech, which seeks to use technology to simplify and streamline the insurance industry.

Regtech, which seeks to help financial service firms meet industry compliance rules, especially those covering Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer protocols that fight fraud.

Robo-advisors, such as Betterment, utilize algorithms to automate investment advice to lower its cost and increase accessibility. This is one of the most common areas where fintech is known and used.

Unbanked/underbanked services that seek to serve disadvantaged or low-income individuals who are ignored or underserved by traditional banks or mainstream financial services companies. These applications promote financial inclusion.

Cybersecurity. Given the proliferation of cybercrime and the decentralized storage of data, cybersecurity and fintech are intertwined.

AI chatbots, which rose to popularity in 2022, are another example of fintech’s rising presence in day-to-day usage.

Fintech Users

There are four broad categories of users for fintech:

Business-to-business (B2B) for banks

Clients of B2B banks

Business-to-consumer (B2C) for small businesses

Consumers

Trends toward mobile banking, increased information, data, more accurate analytics, and decentralization of access will create opportunities for all four groups to interact in unprecedented ways.

As for consumers, the younger you are, the more likely it will be that you are aware of and can accurately describe what fintech is. Consumer-oriented fintech is mostly targeted toward Gen Z and millennials, given the huge size and rising earning potential of these generations.

When it comes to businesses, before the adoption of fintech, a business owner or startup would have gone to a bank to secure financing or startup capital. If they intended to accept credit card payments, they would have to establish a relationship with a credit provider and even install infrastructure, such as a landline-connected card reader. Now, with mobile technology, those hurdles are a thing of the past.

Regulation and Fintech

Financial services are among the most heavily regulated sectors in the world. As such, regulation has emerged as the number one concern among governments as fintech companies take off.

According to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, while fintech firms create new opportunities and capabilities for companies and consumers, they are also creating new risks to be aware of. “Data privacy and regulatory arbitrage” are the main concerns noted by the Treasury. In its most recent report in November 2022, the Treasury called for enhanced oversight of consumer financial activities, specifically when it comes to nonbank firms.

Regulation is also a problem in the emerging world of cryptocurrencies. Initial coin offerings (ICOs) are a form of fundraising that allows startups to raise capital directly from lay investors. In most countries, they are unregulated and have become fertile ground for scams and frauds. Regulatory uncertainty for ICOs has also allowed entrepreneurs to slip security tokens disguised as utility tokens past the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to avoid fees and compliance costs.



Because of the diversity of offerings in fintech and the disparate industries it touches, it is difficult to formulate a single and comprehensive approach to these problems. For the most part, governments have used existing regulations and, in some cases, customized them to regulate fintech.

What are examples of fintech? Fintech has been applied to many areas of finance. Here are just a few examples. Robo-advisors are apps or online platforms that optimally invest your money automatically, often for little cost, and are accessible to ordinary individuals.

Insurtech is the application of technology specifically to the insurance space. One example would be the use of devices that monitor your driving in order to adjust auto insurance rates.

Does fintech apply only to banking? No. While banks and startups have created useful fintech applications around basic banking (e.g., checking and savings accounts, bank transfers, credit/debit cards, and loans), many other fintech areas that have more to do with personal finance, investing, or payments (among others) have grown in popularity.",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fintech.asp,"Fintech, the common-known name of financial technology, is used to describe

"Supply Chain Finance, With An Eye On Size","Supply Chain Finance, With An Eye On Size","Invoice solutions firm Tungsten is linking up with supply chain finance outfit Orbian, with an eye on large corporates providing SCF to their own chains. Prabhat Vira, president of Tungsten’s network finance division, explains how the lengthy list of suppliers on a given company’s chain can benefit from early payment terms.

Supply chains are ever more complex, ever extended and ever disparate in terms of reach and location. For the largest corporations, the network can be, simply put, vast, with thousands of suppliers along various avenues of activity.

In a nod toward reducing complexity and cash flow up and down the supply chain, Tungsten Network said earlier this month that it has partnered with supply chain finance company Orbian to facilitate larger corporate customers’ supply chain finance across the Tungsten network.

In an interview with PYMNTS, Prabhat Vira, president of Tungsten Network Finance, said that the goal of the pact is to extend the services offered to firms using e-invoicing to bring early payment and financing agreements to those larger firms and their suppliers, adding working capital financing tied to invoices. The newest offering comes in the wake of Tungsten Network releasing its Early Payments offering as part of helping firms manage their cash.

Tungsten Network’s Orbian partnership follows the firm’s decision to sell Tungsten Bank at the end of 2016. Tungsten Network had said at the time of that announcement that it would seek a different avenue for bolstering corporate finance offerings.

The executive said that the pact helps form a “one-stop shop” for financing of suppliers’ needs, integrating the Tungsten Network supply chain management with the Orbian supply chain finance solutions. He noted that for some of the larger corporates, across verticals such as autos or more labor/manufacturing intensive niches, supplier count can range from 1,000 to as many as 20,000.

And, said Vira, the clear majority of firms on those supply chains, at an estimated 85 percent to 90 percent, are small to medium sized enterprises.

These smaller firms typically are in need of working capital, or capital for other activities, as they conduct their own activities of sourcing and serving their larger corporate buyers.

The relationship with Orbian, said Vira, is one that offers the duality of efficiency via straight through processing of transactions, and also speed (as applications, acceptance and lending is done digitally), all of which culminates in “a greater efficiency of cash flow.”

Vira also told PYMNTS the solutions offered by the duo do not in fact offer up competition for banks or other traditional lenders. In fact, he continued, the combined platform offerings can serve as a complement to banks (and non-banks, as per Orbian’s clientele). By coming into this relationship, said Vira, invoice financing and working capital activity from those lenders can move beyond high dollar value but low transaction counts. That means bringing more business to the lenders and better working cash flow management to the buyers (hence boosting liquidity) selling invoices to Orbian, he stated.",https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2017/supply-chain-finance-with-an-eye-on-size/,"To reduce complexity and cash flow up and down the supply chain, Tungsten

Being a Southern Capacity Building fellow for the second time is a very big advantage for me. When I was one of the SCBP fellows last year I have acquired a lot of knowledge on how negotiations are undertaken and also CSOs role in the process. Even though the Bonn session in June was the second meeting for this year, the real work started only this time as the previous meeting was all about fighting about the agenda. Most of the first week of June looked more like the Bangkok session as Parties started their discussion on the agenda, which was dealt in Bangkok. As of 2011, in addition to being one of the SCBP fellows, I have a new role that is co-chair of the finance-working group in CAN. One of the greatest benefits of being a SCBP fellow is the experience of getting to know other fellows from different parts of the world and also learn about their works in their respective countries. Additionally, the different experience sharing sessions organized by the coordinator with people who have been in the process for a long time has helped me to understand the process more and also learn from them.

In the two weeks time I have been co-coordinating the finance-working group with a fellow from the SCBP program as well. The finance group has been very active in arranging different bilateral meetings with key countries’ delegates such as Norway, Australia, Bangladesh, Argentina, Japan, Malawi and also representatives from the Technical Support Unit of the Transitional committee that designs the Green Climate Fund. With regard to the finance section in CAN’s Durban Expectation and the negotiations I have given a presentation at CAN’s side event and a press briefing. Since I did both the presentation and press briefing in these negotiations for the first time, I believe I have gained much experience in the preparation and also in the presentations. Additionally I also gave a short update on the negotiations at the end of the first week to GCCA that is shared in their website. As this was the first meeting for this year as a SCBP fellow, I have taken every opportunity to learn more from others and also the process. I feel that I have gained more experience and will be continuing my engagement between the sessions so that I am more prepared for the upcoming sessions.

Network Rail today announced the appointment of its new group finance director, Patrick Butcher. He will take over on 20th April from Ron Henderson who recently announced his retirement.

Between 2004 and 2008 Patrick was finance director (FD) at English Welsh and Scottish Railway (now DB Schenker), the UK's largest rail freight operator where he led the refinancing of the business and was an integral part of the team that oversaw the successful transition of the ownership of EWS to DB Schenker.

Before this he spent two years as FD at Mapeley Ltd, a major property and facilities management company and two years with London Underground as finance director, where he was involved in preparing the company for the introduction of the public private partnership (PPP).

He has also held senior finance roles with King's College Hospital and at the North West Regional Health Authority and spent a number of years at Deloitte and Touche as a management consultant.

Announcing the news, chief executive, Iain Coucher, said: “Patrick is a respected and highly experienced individual whose expertise will help guide and advise the executive team as it looks to deliver challenging targets in both efficiency and performance in the years ahead.""

Mr Butcher, 41, is married with two children.

Notes to editors • In line with normal practice, his appointment will be formally put before Members at the AGM in July. • Mr Butcher's appointment follows the approaching retirement of Ron Henderson's (existing group FD) • Mr Henderson has been with the company since October 2002 and has led a very successful finance and funding team that played a pivotal role in taking Railtrack out of administration and securing the funds to reverse decades of underinvestment in Britain's rail system.
