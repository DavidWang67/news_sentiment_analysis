It claims that energy security and sustainability are at the top of the global agenda, and affordable, accessible energy is critical to enabling the ongoing energy transition.

The Business

The Guernsey-based Chariot is an Africa-focused transitional energy group with three business streams, Transitional Gas, Transitional Power and Green Hydrogen.

- Advertisement -

Transitional Gas – is focused on high value, low risk gas development projects in Morocco, a fast-growing emerging economy, with a clear route to early monetisation, delivery of free cashflow and material exploration upside.

Its Lixus Offshore license covers an area of approximately 1,794 sq.km. The area has data coverage with 3D seismic data covering approximately 1,425 sq.km and five exploration wells, including the Anchois-1 and Anchois-2 discovery wells.

Transitional Power – is focused on providing competitive, sustainable and reliable energy and water solutions across the continent through building, generating and trading renewable power.

Green Hydrogen – is partnering with TEH2 (80% owned by TotalEnergies, 20% by the EREN Group) and the Government of Mauritania on the potential development of a 10GW green hydrogen project, the Project Nour covering two onshore areas over 5,000 sq.km across Northern Mauritania, and it is progressing pilot projects in Morocco.

Deal With Vivo Energy

Last week the group announced that it had signed a Heads of Terms agreement with Vivo Energy regarding future natural gas offtake from the Loukos Onshore licence in Morocco.

Vivo Energy, is a market-leading, pan-African retailer and distributor of high-quality fuels and lubricants with a long-standing presence in Morocco’s petroleum products’ sector.

Through Vivo Energy Maroc, it operates a network of over 400 service stations, supplying commercial and industrial customers across a number of sectors in the Kingdom.

The aim of the agreement is to set out the next steps for implementing a gas-to-industry strategy business, through commercialisation of domestic gas and the creation of a midstream compressed natural gas partnership to supply Morocco’s growing industrial energy needs.

Chariot intends to sell initial volumes of up to 3MMscf/d to the midstream CNG business; additionally, Vivo Energy intends to design, fund, construct and operate a CNG plant and virtual distribution network to transport natural gas.

This midstream CNG business would be operated though a special purpose vehicle in which Chariot can participate up to a 49% interest.

The group will be able to leverage Vivo’s existing Moroccan customer base, allowing it to quickly gain traction into a rapidly growing market.

News Due With Joint Venture Partner Energean

Chariot and its JV partner Energean are expected to spud the offshore Anchois East appraisal/development well in August.

The drilling and testing campaign will further appraise the existing gas sands and target undrilled prospective resources to potentially increase the Anchois gas development to >1Tcf.

Success has the potential to upscale the development and lead to FID shortly thereafter, unlocking further material cash flows from the Energean partnering transaction.

Analyst’s Views

Stephane Foucaud at Auctus considers that the Chariot Core NAV is 30p and the Sum of the Parts valuation is 50p per share.

The high impact Anchois East well continues to be expected to spud in August. A drilling success could increase the size of Anchois to over 1 tcf (300 bcf net to Chariot).

Its overall unrisked NAV for Anchois, including Anchois East Footwall and Anchois East North Flank, is £0.42 per share, which represents nearly six times the current share price.

Foucaud notes that testing of the company’s Dartois discovery onshore Morocco is expected to take place in 3Q24.

潘蘇通破產案未完債主又殺到 銀行入稟追數兼收回中半山單位,"Pan Sutong's bankruptcy case has not yet been completed, and the creditors have come again. The bank has filed a lawsuit to pursue the debt and repossess the Mid-Levels unit.","近年屢傳財困、已辭任高銀金融主席及執行董事職務的潘蘇通，早前因其全資持有的Silver Starlight Limited(下稱「公司」)未有清還80億港元貸款，被高院頒令破產，公司亦遭下令清盤。潘及公司已就高院的判決提出上訴。至上周五(26日)，潘蘇通及其一間關聯公司再被銀行入稟高等法院，要求追討按揭款項，及收回潘位於中半山富匯豪庭的單位。司法機構網頁顯示，本案暫未排期聆訊。

原告是上海商業銀行有限公司，兩名被告依次是潘蘇通及Chariot Power Investments Limited，據入稟狀指，2020年1月14日，就着中半山寶雲道2號富匯豪庭1座27樓B室，原告與兩名被告做按揭貸款，潘蘇通是按揭人，次被告作為借款方，原告是承按人。原告現入稟要求潘蘇通交吉單位，以及要求次被告根據2019年12月31日所簽訂的貸款通知書，支付所有款項連利息，同時要求兩名被告支付本訴訟所衍生的訟費，加上進一步或其他濟助。

據早前報道指，潘蘇通雖然於2022年7月被頒令破產，但因潘未有現身到庭交代其財務狀況，因此法庭在2023年2月批准債務受託人的「不開始令」申請，意指暫不開始計算潘的破產期，直至他與受託人會面為止，這亦意味其4年破產令將會延長。另外，法庭在2023年10月頒判詞指，就潘蘇通的欠債問題，眾債權人於2022年8月舉行債權會議，會議最終裁定潘現時共欠中銀深圳560億港元。但其中一名債權人Seashore Global Group Ltd表明反對。法官最終判定該560億港元均屬潘的欠債。

潘及其公司不服破產及清盤裁決並提出上訴，上訴庭今年1月開庭處理。上訴方當時批評原審法官犯錯，使用錯誤測試原則及門檻去考慮，要求撤銷破產及清盤令，並要求把追款案發還重審。上訴庭當日聽畢雙方陳詞後，表示會於半年內頒發書面裁決。

繼潘蘇通私人持有的豪宅樓盤何文田「傲玟」被接管後，去年初便已傳出潘蘇通名下的富匯豪庭單位已淪為銀主盤，不過當時傳出的是1座高層A、B室，是相連單位。

至於今年初，就高院原訟庭於2022年中頒令潘蘇通破產及其公司清盤一案，潘蘇通不服上訴，其後獲上訴庭押後裁決。

"Zambia And SkyPower Global Partner For 1,000 MW Solar Energy Project","Zambia And SkyPower Global Partner For 1,000 MW Solar Energy Project","SkyPower Global, an independent power producer headquartered in Canada, has entered into a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Zambia’s state-owned utility ZESCO Ltd to supply 1,000 MW of solar energy to the Southern African nation. The agreement, announced jointly by both companies in a press release, supports the Green Giant Zambia project, which aims to provide electricity to approximately 4 million households, stimulate employment opportunities, and bolster Zambia’s economy reliant on copper mining with more renewable energy.

President Hakainde Hichilema highlighted the significance of the Green Giant Zambia project within the framework of Zambia’s Integrated Renewable Energy Plan, particularly amidst the prevailing drought conditions due to climate change. The initiative seeks to significantly expand Zambia’s renewable energy capacity to address both present and future energy requirements, as the country strives to boost industrial productivity and achieve an annual copper production of over 3 million metric tonnes.

While specific details about the project were not disclosed, the initiative mirrors SkyPower’s DRC Green Giant project in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which transitioned from a PPA between SkyPower and the state-owned utility SNEL to a 200-MW first phase development agreement earlier this year.

Last year, President Hichilema welcomed solar energy investments by Masdar from the UAE, emphasizing that Zambia had only developed 3,500 MW of generation capacity since gaining independence.

Chariot aims for first drill on Morocco gas project,Chariot aims for first drill on Morocco gas project,"Chariot LON:CHAR the AIM-listed, Africa focused energy group is hoping to start drilling in Morocco around the end of this quarter at its majority-owned Loukos Onshore project after receiving approval from the Moroccan government for its Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) earlier this month.

The EIA for Loukos covers up to 20 well operations and Chariot will kick off with an initial exploratory drill on two prospective wells at Gaufrette and Dartois and has the option to re-enter an historic gas discovery.

Pierre Raillard, head of gas business and Morocco country director said: “…This is not only an important step towards our initial drilling campaign but EIA approval for multiple additional locations gives us flexibility in future campaigns. In addition to this, the land access activities and civil work contracting have concluded, site construction activities are now underway, and we are on track for commencement of operations around the end of 1Q24.”

Chariot owns 75% of the Loukos Onshore project, the other 25% of is held by Morocco’s national energy company ONHYM.

The Guernsey-headquartered exploration company focuses on three areas: Transitional Gas; Renewable Energy and Green Hydrogen and has a number of interests in other projects on the African continent.

Chariot is an onshore-offshore play

Chariot has been exploring Morocco’s coastline for some time and secured the Lixus Offshore licence, an area of nearly 1,800 square kilometres, with water depths ranging from the coastline to 850 metres in 2019. Within that tenement lay the Anchois Field an 18 billion cubic metre development opportunity. Proving the field through a drilling programme, Chariot confirmed Anchois’ geological model and development potential as a significant gas discovery.

The company also holds an interest in the adjacent Rissana licence, another offshore developmental gas play covering an area of almost 8,500Km2 and with the aforementioned Loukos Onshore development makes up the troika of Chariot’s Moroccan gas projects.

Chariot’s management announced a farm-in with a developmental partner for the Offshore assets in December and brought in FTSE250-listed Energean LON:ENOG as operator to develop the Offshore projects into production.

Energean acquired a 45% interest in Lixus, and a 37.5% interest in the Rissana licence and assumed operatorship. Chariot retained a 30% stake in Lixus and 37.5% of Rissana with ONHYM keeping a quarter of each licence and will receive USD10m in cash on completion, which is expected shortly, followed by another USD15m on Final Investment Decision and USD85m gross carry which covers all Lixus costs up to Final Investment Decision including an additional Anchois well with a gas flow test. The planned Rissana seismic acquisition costs were separately capped at USD7m.

Once Anchois is complete, Energean has the option to acquire another 10% of Chariot’s share in Lixus in return for USD850m gross development carry to first gas and USD50m five-year zero-coupon convertible loan note with a strike price of GBP20 adjusted down for dividends, or the issuance of three million Energean shares, at Chariot’s option on FID. Chariot would also be due a 7% royalty payment on Energean’s gas production revenues in excess of a base hurdle on the realised gas price.

All-in, that’s a good deal for Chariot and a fair deal for Energean and Morocco, with Chariot being suitably compensated for its set-up work on the project, de-risking its portfolio, and allowing it to use the capital realised from the Offshore assets to develop its Onshore project. Energean gets into a new market on what could be a fantastic project for a low initial cost, that Chariot has already spent time and treasure developing to a launchpad level and Morocco gets a partner that has a proven track record taking independent offshore development plays into production. Win-win.





Renewable interests expanding

The company, which operates in six African nations, is also developing 515MW of renewable energy projects at four different sites. The energy developer has zeroed into the mining sector in Africa, providing renewable energy solutions at Iamgold [TMX:IMG]’s Essakane project in Burkina Faso; Tharisa’s PGM mine in South Africa; First Quantum [TMX:FM.]’s Zambian copper-gold mine and Karo Mining’s Zimbabwean PGM mine. Chariot is working in partnership with TotalEnergies, to co-develop these projects on a 49:51 basis.

Chariot has also broadened its exposure and approach to the renewable energy sector within South Africa, in acquiring an interest in Etana Energy, which holds one of a few electricity trading licences to be granted in the country.

Etana’s objective is to deliver unique renewable energy mix solutions at competitive prices to help address the significant power requirements across South Africa with the licence opening access to a range of high-volume off-takers including municipal, industrial and retail customers.

Recently, Chariot announced both an increase to 49% of its stake in this venture and a landmark deal signed with Growthpoint Properties [JSE:GRT] to supply them with 195GWh of renewable energy a year. This represents 32% of Growthpoint’s total current annual electricity consumption and Etana will wheel electricity to their commercial property buildings located in several jurisdictions in South Africa. Electricity trading will bring an additional revenue stream into Chariot and further enable Chariot’s participation in large renewable projects in Southern Africa.

Chariot aims to become leading producer and exporter of green hydrogen

Chariot also operates in Mauritania, where it is working in partnership with TEH2 (80% owned by TotalEnergies and 20% owned by the EREN Group) and the Government of Mauritania to support their ambition to become a leading producer and exporter of green hydrogen.

The project, Project Nour, spans two onshore areas totalling approximately 5,000 square kilometres, across northern Mauritania, which has significant wind and solar potential. As previously reported wind, solar and hydroelectric power is used to electrolyse hydrogen from water and Chariot hopes to develop up to 1.2 million tonnes per year of hydrogen by 2030 with 10GW of renewable energy.

Mauritania would look to use this both domestically and export it to European markets. Project Nour could become one of the largest global projects of its kind and the company has already undertaken a Pre-Feasibility Study and has just completed the Feasibility Study which will be presented to government this quarter.

The project could be transformational for Chariot and Mauritania.

In its last results to end-June 2023, published in September, the company was still loss-making. In the six-month period to end-June 2023 Chariot’s total comprehensive loss was USD7.7m, which was more or less on par year-on-year, but the company remains well-capitalised with USD2.7m cash in the bank, supplemented through a USD19m fundraising completed in July 2023. The company has no debt and minimal licence commitments.

The company opened trading on 13th February at 8.1p and has fallen 51.5% over one-year, with its shares ranging between 7.52p and 18.88p. The company has a market capitalisation of GBP87.3m.

Important catalysts upcoming

The share price is historically low for Chariot, but in the coming months it has important catalysts upcoming with its first drills in Morocco to prove its Loukos project, which should, if proved commercial, start to bring revenue and profit into the company and the well this year at the Anchois project in partnership with Energean.

The potential of its Mauritania hydrogen project could also be transformational for the transitional energy company and its renewable energy business creating independent power plants for mining ventures and electricity trading has the potential to also create a predictable revenue stream.

The market reaction has been a bit harsh on Chariot, and a misunderstanding of the upsides of the Lixus/Rissana deal with Energean have seen something of an over-reaction by the market, given that Chariot still retains significant value in Anchois and its adjacent properties, with a hefty uptick if Energean takes the projects into production. We think that over the next 12-months the share price will start to move north again and could well be within the mid-20p territory and beyond that the stock last saw in 2022.",https://www.thearmchairtrader.com/chariot-aims-for-first-drill-on-morocco-gas-project/,"Chariot LON:CHAR the AIM-listed, Africa focused energy group is hoping to

Drilling on nearby Loukos licence to start early 2024

$19mn equity raise at 14p in July 2023

The key take from Chariot’s (CHAR:14.75p) interim results is that the Africa-focused energy group is close to concluding 'farm-out' negotiations on its flagship Anchois gas development project in Morocco.

Around 40 companies are interested and Chariot has received multiple offers from significantly larger exploration and development (E&P) companies. The offers are based on an upfront cash payment and Chariot retaining a material stake in both the offshore Lixus and Rissana licences, in which the Anchois project is based.

Analyst James McCormack at house broker Cavendish believes that “any farm-out may provide the financing of the capital expenditure to first gas, materially reducing the risk of dilution to shareholders”. However, to provide optionality for the project financing, the directors have lined up a debt consortium of European and Moroccan banks with investment bank Societe Generale.

Importantly, the front-end engineering design (FEED) phase of the project has now been completed, and the environmental social impact assessment is close to being finalised for submission to the Moroccan authorities for approval. It means it is nearing the point of the final investment decision.

Bearing this in mind, Chariot’s management team has been progressing discussions with Office National de l'Electricité et de l'Eau Potable (ONEE) to supply gas directly into the gas-hungry domestic market. The signing of a binding gas sales agreement (GSA) with ONEE to supply up to 60mn standard cubic feet per day (scf) of gas over a 10-year period on a take-or-pay basis is critical. That’s because it not only underpins project financing, but it allows additional expansion as the project develops.

Within Lixus, significant volumes of gas can be unlocked through further drilling. Three key prospects have been identified, all of which could be potential future development hubs and have tie-in capabilities with the planned Anchois infrastructure. At Rissana, Chariot’s team has mapped giant prospective plays with 2U estimates of 7Tcf, independently assessed by Netherland Sewell and Associates.

Chariot’s directors are also in discussions with European entities interested in signing export agreements. That’s because Anchois has an additional 45mn scf of spare ullage, of which some of the spare capacity could be used for export into the European gas market through Spain.

End game of Anchois farm-out process

Admittedly, it has taken time to reach this stage, but an imminent 'farm-out' announcement could be a game-changer for shareholders. It would enable the group to recoup some of the $50mn (£39.2mn) spent on the project and materially de-risk its retained interest.

A successful farm-out is likely to be the catalyst for a major re-rating given that Chariot’s market capitalisation of £148mn is less than 25 per cent of Auctus Advisers’ unrisked valuation of $839mn (£676mn) for the Anchois project. The valuation is based on Anchois’ 1C contingent resources of 365bn cubic feet (bcf) and 2C contingent resources of 637bcf. Both Cavendish and Auctus have a 60p per share core net asset value (NAV) valuation, or four times the current share price.

Drilling programme to start at nearby licence

A farm-out of the Anchois project is not the only newsflow on the horizon. Early next year, Chariot plans to commence a four-well drilling programme on a new onshore Moroccan licence, Loukos.

Located in a conventional, shallow gas play in a basin with a high historic success rate of 80 to 85 per cent and low development costs, it has geological similarities to Chariot's offshore licences, close to existing infrastructure, processing facilities and onshore pipelines for the Anchois gas project. Loukos is well located to supply the industrial offtake market, too, thus offering rapid monetisation of production through Chariot’s recently announced gas-to-industry partnership with Vivo Energy.

Targeting high-graded prospects ranging from 8-18bn cubic feet (Bcf) of best estimate prospective resource potential (Chariot preliminary internal estimates), each well will cost $3mn to drill. A $19mn equity raise in July provides the funding and one that advised supporting at the time (‘A fundraise worth backing’, 12 July 2023). It could be money well spent as McCormack at Cavendish estimates that a 10bcf onshore prospect at an industrial gas price of $11-$12 per million British thermal units could generate gas revenue of $100mn.

Although Chariot’s share price has flatlined since my last article – albeit the holding is showing a 390 per cent gain in my 2017 Bargain Shares Portfolio – it could easily double on a successful Anchois farm-out. Buy.

How can Africa attract more green hydrogen investment?,How can Africa attract more green hydrogen investment?,"Green hydrogen production is becoming established as one of those new industries with a seemingly assured future in which African countries and their copious renewable energy resources are well positioned to play a significant role. More than 50 projects have been proposed across the continent to supply an expected surge in global demand for green hydrogen and products that depend on it.

Leading the way in North Africa are Egypt, Morocco and Mauritania, all well located to serve European markets. In sub-Saharan Africa, South Africa can count on local demand, as well as looking to export markets, with countries such as Angola, Namibia, Kenya and Djibouti also seeking to put their green hydrogen plans in train.

It’s easy to understand the buzz around the industry and the interest development finance institutions (DFIs) are showing in supporting some projects.

Hydrogen is a feedstock suitable for everything from decarbonising energy-intensive industries such as steel and ammonia production to power generation, fuelling some forms of transport and for energy storage.

But climate change concerns mean that its future is limited if traditional production processes, which usually require natural gas and produce a lot of carbon emissions, are used. However, when produced using electrolysis powered by renewable energy, hydrogen becomes a low-emission green fuel across its life cycle.

Green hydrogen’s potential as a versatile, green feedstock has prompted forecasts of rapid growth for the industry. Global demand for green hydrogen could grow sevenfold to 607m tonnes by 2050, according to research published in November 2022 by the Africa Green Hydrogen Alliance (AGHA), led by a group of six African states with high production potential.

Competitive renewables

African countries think they have a shot at catering for a significant slice of the pie, because they have access to some of the world’s cheapest renewable energy, at a time when the cost of electrolysers is also falling. Given that around 60% of hydrogen production costs come from energy inputs, Africa has a competitive edge in that regard at least.

“Solar photovoltaic technology has provided us with the cheapest electricity. [Green hydrogen] will cost below €2 per kg in several African countries by 2030, much lower than the current mass assumption of €5 and a stark contrast to the $60-70 [€55-65] paid for an oil barrel,” said Ajay Mathur, director general of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) in a December 2022 report on the sector.

The report, commissioned by the European Investment Bank, the ISA and the African Union, is boldly titled Africa’s Extraordinary Green Hydrogen Potential. It suggests that the industry could bring €1 trillion of investment to Africa and that the continent could be producing 50m tonnes of green hydrogen a year by 2035.

As with talk of future investment in most African economic sectors, there are a lot of “what ifs” in the various ambitious projections flying around regarding the potential of green hydrogen: investment in plants and the renewable energy to power them and the availability of enough electrolyser capacity and other specialised technology all need to be aligned. Hopes may be high, but the industry is only at an early stage – according to research company Rystad Energy, only 13 MW of the planned 114 GW of green hydrogen electrolysis capacity on its African database had reached a final investment decision by March 2023.

So, it remains to be seen how much investment will materialise across the green hydrogen project pipeline, and whether that investment will find its way to countries that have traditionally struggled to attract it.

Egypt and Morocco draw early investment

Some of the continental hotspots where investment is already starting to flow in are predictable. Egypt is strategically placed at the meeting point of three continents and has already proved an attractive investment target for companies seeking to supply natural gas to Europe. So, it is unsurprising that a country that has also invested heavily in renewable energy resources and has a track record in energy distribution is also leading the way in green hydrogen-related projects.

According to Rystad, Egypt has 21 hydrogen-related projects lined up for development. In the vanguard of the North African country’s push to establish itself as a global hub is a green hydrogen plant at Aik Sokhna in the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCEZ) to supply existing local fertiliser plants operated by Fertiglobe.

Norway’s Scatec, which is leading the project, describes the facility as Africa’s first integrated green hydrogen plant, which when fully developed will consist of 100 MW of electrolysers, powered by 260 MW of solar and wind energy. Commissioning on the first phase of the project got underway in November 2022. The facility is envisaged as supplying up to 15,000 tonnes of green hydrogen as feedstock for production of up to 90,000 tonnes per year of green ammonia at Fertiglobe’s plants.

Larger projects in Egypt, targeting both export and domestic markets, are in the works. In March 2022, Scatec also signed a memorandum of understanding with Egypt for a $5bn project to build a green ammonia plant in the SCEZ with a production capacity of 1m–3m tonnes per year, mainly for export, using green hydrogen as feedstock.

Another project lined up for the SCEZ to target export markets is the Masdar Ain-Sokhna initiative, developed by Masdar and Hassan Allam Holding Group, which will produce 2.3m tonnes per year of ammonia fed by a 4 GW electrolyser plant. Globeleq is also developing a 3.6 GW electrolyser hydrogen project in the SCEZ, producing ammonia for export.

Morocco is also capitalising on its link with European markets to develop several hydrogen projects. The largest is the Amun facility, being developed by CWP Global and Bechtel, which will be able to output 900,000 tonnes per year of hydrogen. Meanwhile TotalEnergies-owned Total Eren is developing the Guelmim-Oued Nour project, targeting output of 710,000 tonnes per year of green hydrogen.

Mauritania aims high

A more surprising regional rival to well-established investment magnets like Egypt and Morocco is Mauritania, which sees green hydrogen production as a way to take advantage of its copious solar resources and support industrial development, which is currently being underpinned by development of the country’s natural gas resources.

If the mooted deals materialise, their impact on the country’s economy should be transformative. Mauritania is set to play host to Africa’s largest green hydrogen project, the $40bn Aman project, which is being developed by CWP Global. Its 15 GW electrolyser capacity will be powered by 18 GW of wind and 12 GW of solar capacity.

Another big hydrogen project in Mauritania’s pipeline is the Nour project, which could reach electrolyser capacity of 10 GW. The project is being developed by UK-based Chariot and Total Eren.

Another project is being developed by Infinity Power Holding – a joint venture between Egypt’s Infinity and Masdar – and German developer Conjuncta. This is expected to produce 8m tonnes per year of hydrogen derivatives supported by 10 GW of electrolyser capacity, with Germany a likely export market.

Activity in the rest of Africa is mainly focused on the south. Several projects have been announced in Namibia. These include the Tsau Khaeb initiative, being developed by local firm Hyphen Hydrogen Energy, which is hoping to attract investment of more than $9bn to produce 300,000 tonnes per year of green hydrogen, using 5 GW of renewable generation capacity and a 3 GW electrolyser. Construction could start in 2025 if permits and investment are in place.

South Africa taps domestic expertise

South Africa already has long-standing expertise in using hydrogen – albeit the relatively high-emission, non-green variety – in industrial processes, such as synthetic aviation fuel production. Now it plans to transition from “grey” to green hydrogen production, if it can tap sufficient quantities of its renewable energy resources, which are much in demand across the rest of the economy.

In December 2022, South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, said the government had identified a R300bn ($16bn) investment pipeline for accelerated development under the country’s Green Hydrogen National Programme. South Africa has an added reason for the sector to succeed, because it accounts for about 75% of world production of platinum, a key ingredient for making polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolysers.

Investment drive ramps up

With other countries such as Angola, Djibouti and Kenya hoping to line up green hydrogen projects, prospects for a sector that could provide Africa with a much-needed economic boost look promising – if the investment keeps flowing.

Ensuring that happens was a major preoccupation at the Africa Green Hydrogen Finance Accelerator Forum, a meeting of African governments, renewable energy and green hydrogen project developers, DFIs and others, held in the Mauritanian capital Nouakchott in April 2023.

The forum issued its “Nouakchott Message”, calling on DFIs to back green hydrogen in Africa before the opportunity is lost. “African governments, in their efforts to enable the green hydrogen economy, are competing with regions with a significantly lower cost of capital and more resources to offer financial incentives. The energy transition will not succeed unless public institutions crowd in private capital for investments in the green energy sector in the developing countries and emerging economies,” the communiqué says.",https://african.business/2023/07/resources/with-e1trn-at-stake-how-can-africa-attract-green-hydrogen-investment,"African countries are in a race against time to establish themselves as

What factors contribute to Mauritania being regarded as a favorable jurisdiction for the production of green hydrogen?

Mauritania is one of the best jurisdictions to produce green hydrogen.

The country has excellent wind resources and high solar radiation, which complement each other well, a lot of land, and a huge coastline of water that can be tapped into.

What factors contribute to Mauritania being regarded as a favorable jurisdiction for the production of green hydrogen?

Mauritania is one of the best jurisdictions to produce green hydrogen because it has excellent wind resources and high solar radiation, which complement each other well, a lot of land, and a huge coastline of water that can be tapped into. These factors allow for the low-cost production of green hydrogen, making it a very competitive market. The government is championing the ongoing development of this sector in the country by encouraging transparency and collaboration, and Mauritania is also favorably located with direct export routes into Europe.

How does the partnership between Chariot and Total Eren benefit the development of Project Nour?

Total Eren, a Total Energies affiliate, has excellent connections around the world, particularly with off-takers for green hydrogen. The company also has a great research and development department in green hydrogen, and the partnership benefits from access to Total Energies’ dedicated technical team. The partnership is a 50/50 split between the two companies, and we are co-developing the project. We have completed the pre-feasibility studies and are currently in the feasibility study phase, which will provide more information on the technical and financial aspects of the project.

In what specific ways does Chariot intend to ensure that the local community in Mauritania derives tangible benefits from the development of Project Nour, taking into account the socio-economic and environmental aspects of the project?

Chariot plans to ensure that the local community in Mauritania benefits from Project Nour by creating job opportunities and supporting the development of the country’s infrastructure. The project will require skilled labor to build the infrastructure for the green hydrogen project, which will provide significant job creation in the build phase, followed by permanent employment opportunities to run various operations. Chariot and Total Eren have experience building projects on the African continent and understand the importance of transferring skills, educating, and investing in the local community. Progressing this project will result in substantial investment in the country.

What are some of the biggest challenges that Chariot faces in terms of scaling up the production of green hydrogen, and how is the company addressing these challenges?

The biggest challenge that Chariot faces in terms of scaling up the production of green hydrogen is the evolving nature of the market. While it is known that hydrogen must be in the mix to achieve carbon net zero, how it will be used is still evolving. The biggest challenge is determining where the majority of hydrogen use will go, but there will be a focus on hard-to-abate sectors. One industry that has been identified is the green steel industry, as current steel production is responsible for 8-12% of all carbon dioxide emissions. The green ammonia market will be important too. The creation of partnerships in financing and developing these large scale projects will also be key across the whole industry, but with up to 10 GW of installed electrolysis, Project Nour could become one of the top 10 green hydrogen projects in the world.",https://energycapitalpower.com/chariot-and-total-erens-project-nour-a-gateway-for-green-hydrogen-in-mauritania/,"Energy Capital & Power spoke to Adonis Pouroulis, CEO of Chariot, who

"Africa and Europe set to be the dynamos for the global green hydrogen 
economy","Africa and Europe set to be the dynamos for the global green hydrogen 
economy","Africa’s total announced electrolyzer pipeline capacity has reached 114 gigawatts (GW), with 61% of this tied to countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, according to Rystad Energy analysis. This African region has an announced electrolyzer pipeline of about 70GW, with Mauritania covering 50% of the total, followed by South Africa and Namibia. Sub-Saharan Africa holds a highly strategic position for the development of a successful green hydrogen economy as South Africa sits on about 90% of the world’s global platinum group metals reserves – critical for the production of polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzers.

The major impediment to building these mega projects and associated infrastructure will be investment. According to Rystad Energy research, just 13 megawatts (MW) of the planned 114 GW has reached a final investment decision to date. The continent’s access to land, low labor costs and renewable power potential has been attracting attention from further afield, with Germany signing offtake deals with Namibia and South Africa. Norway has taken a different approach by providing $8 million of funding to Scatec, a Norwegian renewable company, to develop green hydrogen projects in Egypt.

These initial moves are set to accelerate as Europe struggles with an ongoing energy crisis and seeks new partners. Part of the recently released European Union Green Industrial Plan seeks to promote renewable energy and green hydrogen projects across Africa, with an eye on establishing sustainable investment facilitation agreements to attract and expand regional investments. Germany alone intends to import 50% to 70% of its hydrogen to feed its domestic demand by 2030, with much being sourced from Africa. With plans to construct 17 GW to 21 GW of hydrogen-ready gas-fired power plants by 2030, Germany’s commitment to the green hydrogen economy is substantial. To facilitate imports, Germany recently launched a €900 million ($957 million) auction scheme called H2Global, securing purchase guarantees for hydrogen producers outside of Europe exclusively. According to Rystad Energy analysis, African states are currently in the best position to supply green hydrogen in the quantities Europe requires.

The global green hydrogen economy is beginning to take shape, with Africa and Europe becoming a dynamo of production and use. Africa’s unparalleled mineral reserves are critical for electrolyzer production and the region’s fantastic renewable potential combined with Europe’s prodigious production and import targets will not just alter energy flows, they will create them anew, Says Rajeev Pandey, clean tech analyst at Rystad Energy

Egypt and Morocco

According to Rystad Energy research, there are a total of 52 green hydrogen projects announced in Africa. The production curve shows a sharp increase after 2025 when these projects start ramping up production and reach 7.2 million tonnes by the end of 2035. Most of the announced projects will be producing ammonia as an end-product for export to Europe.

Egypt's unique geographical location at the crossroads of Africa, Europe and Asia, as well as its control of the Suez Canal, places the country in a strategic position to become a global green energy hub. With 21 projects in the pipeline, Egypt stands in top position in terms of green hydrogen-producing countries in Africa. Scatec struck an agreement with the Egyptian government for the development of a green ammonia facility producing up to 3 million tonnes per annum (tpa), which will be mainly exported to European and Asian markets. Another project looking for an export market in Europe is the Masdar Ain-Sokhna project, which will be developed by Masdar and Hassan Allam Holding Group using a 4 GW electrolyzer plant at SCZONE (Suez Canal Economic Zone), producing 2.3 million tpa of ammonia. Similarly, Globeleq announced it will develop a 3.6-GW electrolyzer project at SCZONE, producing ammonia for export to Europe and Asia. Other major green hydrogen projects are the ACME green ammonia project (400,000 tpa), the Fortescue-Egypt-gH2 project (300,000 tpa), and the SCZONE-ReNew Power project (200,000 tpa).

Morocco's Amun project, with an annual hydrogen capacity of 900,000 tpa and developed by CWP Global along with North American EPC player Bechtel, is the largest in Morocco. The Guelmim-Oued Nour project, announced by Total Eren, will be capable of producing 710,000 tpa of green hydrogen. Other projects contributing to green hydrogen in Morocco include the Hevo Ammonia Morocco project (31,000 tpa), the Masen Green Hydrogen project (8,400 tpa), and the Ben Guerir project (125 tpa).

Mauritania

Geographical proximity to the Mauritanian deepwater port of Nouadhibou and the large European market for exports make the green hydrogen project on Mauritania potentially very lucrative. Contributing to Mauritania’s pipeline capacity are the Aman project (with a production of 1.7 million tpa), the Nour Electrolyzer project (1.2 million tpa), and the Masdar-Infinity-Conjuncta green hydrogen project (1.36 million tpa). The $40-billion Aman green hydrogen project is being developed by CWP Global and is the largest green hydrogen project in Africa. It will have a 15 GW electrolyzer capacity, powered by 30 GW of combined solar and wind. The Nour project developed by Africa-focused transitional energy group Chariot Limited and Total Eren is the second-largest green hydrogen project in Mauritania with the potential to reach up to 10 GW of electrolysis. The $34-billion Masdar-Infinity-Conjuncta green hydrogen project expects to produce 8 million tpa of hydrogen derivatives using a 10-GW electrolyzer capacity. The project will have a strong connection with Germany in terms of both a technology provider and a potential offtaker. However, given their size, if either of these projects gets delayed, Mauritania’s target may be in question. Also, Mauritania’s Socieetee Nationale Industrielle et Mianieere signed a memorandum of understanding with ArcelorMittal to establish a palletization plant and a direct reduced iron (DRI) production plant in the country to produce 2.5 million tpa of green steel per annum.

Namibia

With the announced 3-GW Tsau Khaeb and the 2.5-GW Tumoneni projects, Namibia is gaining momentum in the green hydrogen economy. Namibian player Hyphen Hydrogen Energy will develop Tsau Khaeb, targeting a phased production of around 300,000 tpa with an estimated investment of $9.4 billion. The necessary feasibility, engineering and permitting processes are ongoing, with the hope of enabling construction to commence in January 2025 and commissioning of the first phase expected by the end of 2026.

The 42-MW Daures Green Hydrogen Village project secured a $15 million grant from the German Ministry of Education and Research to implement a pilot project over the course of 18 months. Also, French independent power producer HDF Energy aims to build the 50-MW Swakopmund project – Africa’s first integrated solar-hydrogen project. The developer awarded SLR Environmental Consulting the environmental impact assessment work. Namibia is also eyeing the development of three hydrogen valleys to be located at Kharas, Walvis Bay port and Kunene, respectively, where the goal is to produce green ammonia as an end-product for export.

Djibouti, South Africa and others

Djibouti has good solar, wind and geothermal resources. CWP Global signed an agreement with the government to develop a 10-GW renewable energy and green hydrogen hub. With this project, CWP Global becomes the biggest developer in the Africa . Fortescue Future Industries also signed a partnership with the Djiboutian government to conduct studies on the development of green hydrogen at two sites – one in north-Goubet and the other in Obock.

In South Africa, projects focusing on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) are attracting significant attention. Sasol and a consortium comprising Linde, Enertrag and Navitas Holdings collaborated to produce SAF with the support of the German government’s H2Global auction platform. Sasol is exploring a feasibility study at the Secunda Synfuel plant and opportunities for possible export to Germany. Hive Hydrogen announced a $4.6-billion, 780,000-tpa Green Ammonia Plant with its dedicated power supply at the Coega Special Economic Zone alongside the Port of Ngqura. The German government has also approved a €15 million subsidy for chemicals company Linde to fund the HySHiFT renewable hydrogen project in Mpumalanga, which is being pursued in collaboration with Sasol, Enertrag and Hydregen Energy. The companies plan to construct a facility producing e-kerosene using a 200-MW electrolyzer plant.

Other Sub-Saharan countries have also announced green hydrogen projects, including Angola’s 300-MW green ammonia facility being developed by Sonangol that will export around 280,000 tpa of green ammonia to Germany, and Kenya’s 300-MW green ammonia and green fertilizer facility powered by existing geothermal energy.
