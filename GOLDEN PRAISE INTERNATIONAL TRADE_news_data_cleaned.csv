With Britain's negative attitude to wealth creation, we risk killing the goose that lays the golden eggs Brits have become poorer since 2010 while people in the US and Germany are 10% richer

The following is a transcript of a lecture delivered at the Legatum Institute in London on Thursday 9th November 2023.

When I was invited to give this lecture, I did what any GenXer would do and Googled ‘In Praise of Business’. The top link was a 2007 article from The Independent, ‘In praise of business lounges‘. The second was a 2016 article from The Financial Times on ‘Seven tips for getting more out of business travel‘. And the third was an article from The Spectator, and I thought, great, I’m in luck here. I clicked on the link and got an article ‘In Praise of Minding Your Own Business‘.

This is a long way of saying that woefully little has been written or said in praise of business. But even though this subject is academically neglected, it is – I believe – critical to our future prosperity as a country.

I want to lay out a simple argument, in five parts. First, that business is a powerful force for good, both in our society and across the world. Second, that business is viewed more negatively in Britain today than in other countries and indeed more negatively than at any other time in our modern history. Third, that this anti-business feeling has been formed by how companies and business leaders are presented in our educational, cultural and political institutions. Fourth, that this sentiment has, in turn, driven increasingly anti-business policy, damaging our economy and society in the process. And finally, that this situation can be turned around, by championing a practical case for business that resonates with voters.

So, I come here: to praise business; lament how business is viewed; describe how this has come about; explain how it has affected our prosperity; and finally tell you how we can turn this around.

What has business done for us?

Let’s begin by looking at what business has done for us.

Many of you will remember the film Monty Python’s Life of Brian, especially the scene where John Cleese, Michael Palin and Eric Idle sit amongst a group of local tribesmen lamenting the Romans, asking each other, ‘What have the Romans ever done for us?‘. Slowly they realise the Roman Empire had introduced all the great innovations of the day – the aqueduct, sewerage, roads, irrigation, medicine, education, public order, and so on.

It was a cute and clever way to make the point that an unthinking public can sometimes overlook the bleeding obvious. In this vein, I believe unequivocally, and – sadly – against the weight of public opinion, that business has had a profoundly positive impact on modern society.

Since the earliest Joint-Stock Companies were formed at the turn of the 16th Century, business has driven the development of seaborne trade, the Industrial Revolution and mass production.

More recently, we can thank business for the development of: the telephone; the megaphone; the iPhone; the combustion engine; the search engine; a thousand life-saving medical breakthroughs; the ‘to-go’ cappuccino, and the ability to watch 24-hour news and Premier League football anywhere around the world.

It’s the innovators and disruptors leading a business, delivering great products and services, who drive economic and social progress.

It was an entrepreneur, Richard Arkwright, who spurred the Industrial Revolution in Britain, when he invented the Spinning Frame in 1764, which mechanised cotton manufacturing. 70 years later, another Lancashire-born businessman, Richard Hornsby, developed the first steam engines that went on to be used in tractors and trains.

In the U.S., Thomas Edison, with financial support from John Pierpoint Morgan, set up the Edison Electric Light Company, which patented and commercialised lighting systems.

One of Edison’s oldest friends, Henry Ford, designed and manufactured the first mass-produced affordable motor vehicle.

Air travel was pioneered by a group of visionary U.S. entrepreneurs, including William Boeing.

Half a century later, Freddie Laker took on the established airlines and turned air travel from a business luxury to an affordable option for tourists.

And Martha Lane Fox then made international travel even more affordable with LastMinute.com.

In the tech space, Bill Gates and Paul Allen changed the world by building software products that still dominate our PCs today.

And here in the UK, Demis Hassabis founded Deep Mind in 2010, which was bought by Google in 2014 and is leading the way on AI.

Where would we be had these individuals not had the bravery, tenacity and drive to create products and services that have had such a positive impact on humanity?

This is why I look at entrepreneurs today, and marvel at what they have in store for us tomorrow. JCB is developing a hydrogen engine for its excavators, which will massively reduce the carbon footprint on building site. Vodafone and Safaricom have created M-PESA, expanding access to banking and money transfers for millions of people, opening up incredible opportunities for commerce across Africa, And OpenAI used a $1bn investment from Microsoft to build ChatGPT, the first easy-to-use AI platform

These are just three examples of technology, developed by entrepreneurs, revolutionising our lives.

And this is what people most like about business: great products and services, at reasonable prices.

Lessons From History

But my lecture this evening is not really about such headline-grabbing products. I want to talk about how business has been the biggest driver of global prosperity and social progress across history.

We should never forget that the countries that spent the 20th Century liberalising their economies, allowing entrepreneurs to set up businesses and trade freely, prospered immeasurably more than the countries that did not.

At the end of the Second World War, global economic power lay in the U.S. and Western Europe. In per capita terms, East Asian countries were a fraction as wealthy as European countries. They were even poorer than South American, Caribbean and some African countries.

By the year 2000, the Japanese economy was larger than that of France and Germany. Between 1960 and 2000, China’s GDP per capita had grown by 821%, and South Korea’s by a whopping 1,554%.

By 2010, the average East Asian economy was one-third richer than the economies of South America, 70% richer than the petrostates of the Middle East and North Africa, and six times richer than the economies of Sub-Saharan Africa.

What explains this massive divergence in fortunes? What explains the explosion of growth in East and South-East Asian economies, allowing them to catch up with their Western competitors?

It was not linked to direct foreign assistance or foreign aid. Nor was it a result of government interventions, the creation of a welfare state or the proliferation of trade unions. It was down to a set of basic economic and political conditions that allowed economies to grow.

Those conditions were: stable government, control of the money supply, responsible public financial management, the elimination of monopolies, and (most importantly) a rules-based system that leaves economic decision-making to private individuals and enterprises, free to engage in trade with each other and the rest of the world.

In short, as the economic historian David Henderson puts it:

‘The primary direct impulse of economic progress comes from profit-related activities and initiatives on the part of business enterprises.’

The key to prosperity is therefore a conducive business environment.

How is business viewed today?

So, having established that business is a force for good, let me turn to how British society perceives business today. After all, if business is such a force for good, surely it is viewed positively by the public?

Despite the clear and overwhelming empirical evidence that businesses are essential to our prosperity and progress, they are counter-intuitively unpopular. A deep dive into all the market research we have done at the Jobs Foundation on how business is perceived in the UK is another lecture in its own right. And we are the only group to have looked into this subject for some time.

Just 36% of the British public think that large businesses have a positive impact on the country, compared to 52% of Americans. 47% of Brits believe that entrepreneurs deserve to be rich, compared to 53% of Americans and (much to my surprise) a very healthy 66% of people in France. And again, Brits are less likely to say they trust business leaders than the Australians, Germans, Swedes and Spanish.

But not only is the UK a geographic outlier, we are also less friendly towards the business community than we were in previous decades. In 1986, just 36% of respondents felt corporate profits were too high. By 2000 – well before the global financial crisis – 60% of people thought profits were too high. In 1985, 39% of people felt that the amount of tax that business and industry paid was too high, compared to 7% who thought it was too low. Fast forward 40 years and the numbers have basically inverted, with 10% now saying that business taxes are too high, and a chunky 49% believing they are too low. And – most damningly – in 1986, 80% of Brits wanted to live in a free-market system, whereas today, a massive 67% of people are open to the idea of living in a socialist economic system.

So, to put it mildly, the British public are sceptical about business and enterprise.

Why is business viewed so poorly?

How has this change in opinion come about?

More research needs to be done on this topic, but my initial thesis is that these negative perceptions have been shaped by how business is presented in our educational, cultural and political institutions.

Schools

Anti-business influences begin with school-aged children. I was watching a relatively new movie called Clifford the Big Red Dog with my eldest daughter Lottie, aged six, the other day. I was expecting an innocuous story about a big red dog, but what I got was an hour of propaganda: a story featuring an evil Silicon Valley billionaire and a kindly Chinese businessman, Mr Yu, who is trying to save the world.

This one example illustrates how children are exposed to negative portrayals of business from a young age, and it continues when they begin school.

A poll of teachers in 2020 found widespread support for including global social justice issues in the national curriculum. They were reported to consider civil disobedience to be an appropriate part of the curriculum.

To its credit, following reports of teachers preaching anti-business lessons to pupils, the Department for Education issued guidance to all state schools categorising ‘anti-capitalist’ opinions as an extreme position and disallowed in the classroom.

Universities

Now look at our Higher Education institutions.

If you go to the blog of my alma mater, the London School of Economics, you will find recent articles by academics on: How the very rich are dysfunctional and unjust; how zero-hours contracts are a modern form of slavery, and the corruption of British politics by business.

Bristol University Press recently published a series of pamphlets on Alternatives to Capitalism in the 21st Century. Or take the Oxford Union: in recent months it has hosted the left-wing US Senator Bernie Sanders, two former porn stars (on two separate occasions), an actress from Game of Thrones, rapper Buggzy Malone, and TV celebrity Matt Hancock.

Good for them. I have no problem with any of those speakers. But the only notable entrepreneur invited to Oxford in recent months was one of the technologists behind Skype, talking about AI, not business. It’s a shame that students attending the Oxford Union hear from more porn stars than business stars.

The media

Cynicism towards business is palpably evident in the media, even in the business sections, and it appears to be more evident in the UK than elsewhere.

The other day, I compared the business stories in the UK and US media. The FT was reporting Deloitte axing jobs and the FTX court case. The Times ran with stories about subdued consumer spending and how IHG was disappointing investors.

Conversely, over in the US, The Wall Street Journal ran a story on how United Airlines was improving customer service for economy class passengers and how Procter and Gamble had achieved impressive results. Even The New York Times – hardly a bastion of pro-business optimism – celebrated strong results at Netflix and ran a kind obituary on one of the pioneers of Cable TV.

Positive news stories are sprinkled across the pages of US business sections. The same cannot be said in UK.

The Independent recently reported that Shell’s ‘obscene‘ profits had hit a 115-year high. And an article in The Guardian described supermarkets as ‘corporate wreckers‘ making ‘runaway profits’. And – for what it’s worth – I don’t recall ever seeing an FT leader ‘In Praise of Business’.

Over at the BBC, they recently produced a podcast called Good Bad Billionaires, which, ‘finds out how the richest people on the planet made their billions, and then judges them for it.’

I listened to a few episodes, hoping that these billionaires would be judged on the products they had invented, or the jobs they created, but I didn’t hear any of that. Put it like this: the series wasn’t designed to encourage budding entrepreneurs to follow their dreams.

Whilst it is absolutely right that the Sam Bankman-Frieds of this world receive proper scrutiny, if people only hear about the bad apples, they will soon conclude that the entire crop is rotten.

Popular culture

But perhaps the British news media are just reflecting the wider scepticism and cynicism in popular culture.

From the relatively innocuous Dragons’ Den to Alan Sugar’s The Apprentice, business leaders are conventionally portrayed as cut-throat, money obsessed and amoral.

In so many of our favourite blockbuster movies and series, the villain is often big business – Lexcorp in Superman, Skynet in the The Terminator, Logan Roy in Succession, Gordon Gekko in Wall Street, and, of course, Mr Burns in The Simpsons – the ultimate corporate baddie.

In fact, a number of years ago, a study on how business is presented on US television found that 40% of the fictional murders in films and dramas are committed by businessmen. Unless drug dealers and mafia bosses are counted amongst their number, there is no way this stat reflects reality. But it does – crucially – shape how ordinary people view business leaders in their everyday lives.

Sometimes the negative characterisation of business in popular culture is justified. I’m not here to defend the corporate super-polluter PG&E in Erin Brockovich, but for every film about business baddies, where are the films ‘In Praise of Business’?

It’s a free society and TV and film production companies are free to pick subjects of their choosing, so perhaps a key moral of this story is that socialism sells?

Parliament

One group we can criticise, however, are our friends in Parliament and Whitehall. They are not chasing a profit; they are guardians of the economy and our prosperity.

We are all familiar with politicians wooing business – and quite right too! Tony Blair’s prawn cocktail offensive and George Osborne’s penchant for being photographed in high viz and a hard hat are both emblematic of this. But if you dig deeper, feelings from ambivalence right through to resentment are visible.

From Boris Johnson’s infamous ‘f— business’, to John McDonnell arguing that inflation is simply a symptom of corporate greed, or Jeremy Hunt not mentioning business once in his speech at Conservative Party Conference this year; all these are examples of political leaders either directly criticising business, or not using their platforms to explain why business is essential for our prosperity.

In Parliament itself, there are currently 763 All-Party Parliamentary Groups. There’s an APPG on health, an APPG on education – even APPGs on cats and (to return to a theme at the beginning of this lecture) an APPG on business travel – but there isn’t an APPG representing the business community as a whole. There are groups for rural businesses, hospitality businesses in Wales, and ethnic minority business owners and – admittedly – a group for entrepreneurship and one for financial services, but not an APPG for business.

Or take a look at the work of the House of Commons Business and Trade Committee. Much of their work seems to involve shouting at and belittling businesses, rather than championing their cause. For example, in June and July, they blamed supermarkets and forecourt operators for food and fuel price inflation. These are legitimate issues to look into, but they don’t appear to have conducted an inquiry in recent years into, for example, how Britain is falling behind other countries as far as the ease of doing business is concerned, and how this might affect our prosperity.

There is a similar dearth of debate about entrepreneurship on the floor of the House of Commons. A search of Hansard online suggests that the last time the Government initiated a debate on ‘Support for businesses and entrepreneurs’ was almost five years ago.

There have been other entrepreneur-related debates in recent years: on women entrepreneurs in April 2019; on government support for female entrepreneurs in October 2020; on female entrepreneurs in July 2022, and on entrepreneurs from minority ethnic backgrounds in December 2022.

All these are important issues and absolutely worthy of discussion – but they are narrow aspects of business policy, not a big picture examination of the overall health of British business.

Whitehall

Moving across the road from Parliament to Whitehall, the overall relationship between Government and Business can be described as chaotic and dysfunctional at best.

For example, there have been seven incarnations of the Prime Minister’s Business Council over the past eight years.

The Department for Business and Trade itself has also been through numerous incarnations in recent decades. Until earlier this year, it was two entities – the Department for International Trade and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.

BEIS itself was created in 2016 from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Department for Energy and Climate Change. BIS was formed in 2009 from the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills. BERR was established in 2007 out of what had been the Department for Trade and Industry since 1970, which prior to that had been the Board of Trade.

So, when it comes to dealing with government, business leaders should be forgiven for mixing up their DBTs, BEISs, BISs, BERRs, DTIs and BOTs. I doubt there is any serious business in the UK which has gone through as many organisational changes in the same period of time.

Similarly, since 2010, we’ve had nine Business Secretaries, 11 Ministers for Enterprise, Markets and Small Business, and the equivalent of a different Minister for Trade every year for the past 13 years.

From this organisational upheaval and churn of personnel, many business leaders have understandably concluded that Whitehall doesn’t take its relationship with business particularly seriously.

This is not a criticism of the No 10 business team, which is undoubtedly underpowered compared to our competitors. For example, a recent Centre for Policy Studies report called ‘Why Choose Britain?’ noted that the French Government is far better at rolling out the red carpet for business leaders from around the world. We should follow suit. And last week’s Bletchley Park AI Summit and the second Global Investment Summit later this month are both welcome steps in this direction.

But look at the overall architecture of Whitehall and how the Civil Service allocates personnel. It’s noticeable, for example, that whilst the Foreign Office has roughly 73 members of staff in the British High Commission in South Africa, they have just one Tech Envoy in our Consulate in Silicon Valley. With Google’s market cap alone being more than four times the size of South Africa’s economy, it is surely worth considering whether our country’s external affairs personnel are being appointed with a more 19th Century view of global power and influence in mind, rather than our needs as a country and economy in the 21st Century.

Why does this matter?

But why does the general anti-business attitude of our educational, cultural and political institutions matter? What does this have to do with our country’s prosperity, and the ability of households up and down the country to put food on the table and keep warm this winter?

As a bedtime story, I was reading one of Aesop’s Fables to my daughters the other night – The Goose that Laid the Golden Eggs. As you will remember, the impatient and greedy countryman had the idea of getting all the golden eggs at once by killing the Goose and cutting it open: ‘But when the deed was done, not a single golden egg did he find, and his precious Goose was dead.‘

Ladies and Gentlemen, I put it to you that, as a society, we are at risk of killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. And that our elected representatives – being understandably close followers of public opinion – are going beyond just clipping the wings of our golden goose, they are already significantly injuring it.

Taxation

Taxation – a subject I began my career discussing – is a huge disincentive to enterprise.

The total tax burden in the UK is the highest it has been since records began. As a percentage of GDP, it has been on an upward trajectory since 1993, when it stood at 28% of GDP. This year, the Institute for Fiscal Studies forecast it will reach 37% of GDP.

Unsurprisingly, the latest International Tax Competitiveness Index from the Tax Foundation, which ranks the 38 OECD countries on how pro-growth their tax systems are, suggests that the UK has dropped another three places from last year, to reach 30th out of 38 in the rankings.

As a society, we are clearly getting greedy about the number of golden eggs we wish to extract from the private sector.

Regulation

When it comes to regulation, you will often hear how competitive Britain is as place to do business. But that ignores the huge burdens which successive governments have placed on business in recent decades.

A small business owner, for example, will probably have to appoint and pay for a lawyer, an accountant, a pensions administrator, an occupational health lead, a Health and Safety Officer, and – I’m not making this up – a bereavement counsellor.

A small business with just one employee may have to have an HR policy, disciplinary and grievance procedures. It will have to file with the Information Commissioner. the local council for business rates, Companies House and HMRC. It will have to set up a workplace pension scheme, take out employers’ insurance, keep a record of invoices, statements, expenses and staff contracts, write a health and safety Policy, display health and safety notices and – finally – keep accident and incident reports.

This is not to say that some of these regulations are not necessary, but we should recognise the burden they place on smaller businesses.

The exodus of wealth creators

Perhaps the starkest indicator of the increasing burdens on business is the exodus of wealth creators.

UBS released a report in 2023 which showed the number of millionaires living in Britain had declined between 2021 and 2022, from just under 3m to just over 2.5m.

Forbes’ Billionaires List shows that between 2010 and 2020, Britain saw a slower rate in growth in the number of billionaires than most of our competitors. By 2020 there were twice as many billionaires in Germany than Britain, nearly nine times as many in China, and 14 times as many in America.

But this is not about the number of millionaires or billionaires, what’s important is how this has affected ordinary people.

Lower GDP per capita

Between 2010 and 2020, British GDP per capita actually declined, by 1%. Yes, you heard that correctly: our average citizen ended the last decade poorer than they began it.

In contrast Canadians were 3% wealthier, the Dutch 4% wealthier, Aussies 8% wealthier, the average Dane 9% wealthier, people in the US and Germany 10% wealthier, and Kiwis a very creditable 11% wealthier.

In 2021, UK GDP per capita was roughly (in dollar terms) $45,000. The poorest state in the US was Mississippi, with a GDP per capita of approximately $46,000. It is quite shocking to consider that, were Britain to be the 51st State of America, it would also be the poorest.

Poor economic growth is a result of the UK’s steadily declining business environment, which is, in turn, a product of the political environment, which is shaped by the public’s overall attitude to business.

How to make the case for business

So how can we do a better job making the case for business? How can we turn the tide of public opinion? The case for business, can be made in all sorts of ways.

The theological case

For the more religious amongst us, there are deeper theological and cultural roots to our appreciation of business and enterprise.

Judaism dictates that all wealth is held by God, and our role on earth is to safeguard it through decent work and innovation. The late great Rabbi Jonathan Sacks said that, ‘business, and the market economy generally, plays a moral role in society’ by virtue of the jobs they provide.

Catholicism sees business as being one of four pillars that upholds society (alongside the Church, the state and the family). And our last Methodist Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, nailed the necessity of enterprise when she reflected that, ‘No one would remember the Good Samaritan if he’d only had good intentions – he had money as well.’

And whilst Islam is perhaps better known for stipulating forbidden economic practices – from charging interest to selling pork – it too has a strong foundational belief in the role of business. The Prophet Mohammed was, after all, a merchant. And the Hadith says, ‘the honest and trustworthy merchant will be with the prophets.’

The philosophical case

For those who look to philosophy for moral guidance, an array of thinkers have espoused free enterprise, not just as a means of wealth creation, but also because it fosters relationships, fulfilment and the good life.

Adam Smith’s Theory of Moral Sentiments recognises that economic relationships can lead to deep and meaningful personal relationships. For this reason, Smith correctly predicted that when countries trade, conflict would become less likely.

Smith led to David Ricardo, who leads on to the more contemporary work of Friedreich Hayek, whose Road to Serfdom argued against the excessive encroachment of government into both markets and our everyday lives.

John Maynard Keynes, the father of progressive economic thinking, was glowing in his praise for Hayek’s work, saying, ‘Morally and philosophically I find myself in agreement with virtually the whole of it.’

The practical case

But no matter how persuasive (or not) the works of Hayek or Keynes might be to people in this room – not to mention the Torah, New Testament or Qur’an – I can tell you, drawing on my 25 years of political campaigning, that they ain’t gonna persuade the public.

We spent a good chunk of last year at the Jobs Foundation asking the public some deeper questions about their views on business: what they like, what they dislike, and what value they see in businesses contributing to society.

The big finding was that the British public are irritated by corporates who focus on social fads, rather than providing great products and services at reasonable prices.

When asked what businesses should focus on: 42% want them to focus on the pricing of products; 34% want them to prioritise the quality of products; just 4% want companies to concentrate on their social purpose, and just 1% want them to campaign on social issues.

Yet to look at the websites of many business groups, or the LinkedIn accounts of many corporates, the main impression is that they place more importance on their contribution to CSR, EDI and ESG, and see the fundamentals of their business as almost an afterthought.

From the same polling, what else do people want businesses to focus on? 31% value the role business play in creating jobs; 30% value the tax they pay, and 22% value the training they provide for staff.

This is why I would always encourage people to champion the role that businesses play in creating jobs, providing training and funding public services. It’s a message that resonates with the public and demonstrates how business is a force for good.

To take each of these – briefly – in turn.

Jobs

Since January 2010, businesses have created 87% of the new jobs in the British economy. That is 3.4m additional jobs in the economy, 3.4m more people who have an income, purpose, structure, a place to go and a sense of self-worth and 3.4m people who are now better placed to put food on the table for their families, heat their homes, cover the rent and pay water and electricity bills

Training

We also rely on businesses for training, for boosting meritocracy and social mobility. A strong business isn’t governed by a rigid hierarchy. A strong business rewards new ideas and performance. Those who work the hardest are inevitably promoted, paid more or head-hunted.

Look at the careers of Pret A Manger CEO Pano Christou, former M&S boss Stuart Rose, or Mary Barra, the American CEO of General Motors – all of them started their careers at the company they went on to run.

According to the Sutton Trust, the proportion of CEOs who were educated in the state system overtook the percentage who were educated in the private and grammar systems for the first time in 2015. Businesses therefore recognise that talent is not confined to private schools and Oxbridge.

Tax

As well as creating jobs and training people, businesses are also responsible for paying the tax that funds our public services.

Last year, UK companies paid some £67bn in Corporation Tax. Companies are also on the hook for VAT, National Insurance Contributions, Business Rates and an array of other duties, levies and tariffs charged in different parts of their supply chains.

In fact, PWC calculate that in 2022, Corporation Tax was just one-third of the total taxes borne by businesses – meaning their total tax burden was closer to £201bn last year.

But it doesn’t end there. Businesses pay their employees’ salaries, upon which Income Tax is paid. With roughly three in four jobs being in the private sector, then roughly three-quarters of the Income Tax take is generated by businesses – some £187bn.

And as for the £63bn of Income Tax receipts generated from public sector employees, don’t forget that these jobs would not exist were it not for the tax receipts from the private sector.

So in reality – aside from Inheritance Tax receipts on assets acquired by ancestors long, long ago – every pound of tax paid to the Exchequer originates thanks to the hard work and enterprise of a business leader.

This is why a healthy public sector depends on a healthy private sector.

So, in summary, on the priorities for business that matter to people – creating jobs, providing training and funding public services – the business community has an extremely good story to tell. They just need to begin telling it.

Concluding remarks

I would like to bring this lecture to a close with a quote from Winston Churchill: ‘Some people regard private enterprise as a predatory tiger to be shot. Others look on it as a cow they can milk. Not enough people see it as a healthy horse pulling a sturdy wagon.‘

In saying this, Churchill neatly highlighted the lack of appreciation for business as being the engine which motors our economy, or the goose that lays the golden ggg.

One of the great privileges of my career has been meeting people from the business community. Entrepreneurs who have built incredible companies that employ thousands of people in Britain and across the globe. Industrialists who have climbed the corporate ladder and now shepherd some of Britain’s blue-chip companies. Third generation descendants who first worked on the shop floor and then took the reins of their family business, and small business owners who are as much the cornerstone of their local community as the parish priest, the publican or the policeman.

I have never lost my sense of awe for someone who wakes up, goes to work, builds a business and creates jobs, while providing excellent service to their customers and helping their local community.

This helped me realise, early on in my life, that business is a phenomenal force for good in the world.

I know that not everyone shares my enthusiasm, but I hope the Jobs Foundation will help reverse the wave of cynicism.

The world needs it; our economy needs it; and the well-being of families depends on it.

So, I hope you will join me, and the Jobs Foundation, in making the case: ‘In Praise of Business’.

As the 8-day Golden Week holidays approach, tourists are swarming to China's famous landmarks and scenic spots like Tian'anmen Square in Beijing, the Bund in Shanghai, and West Lake in Hangzhou, East China's Zhejiang Province. The vibrant atmosphere, buzzing with excitement and activities, serves as a vivid reflection of the unwavering confidence of the Chinese people in the country's economy and bright future.An estimated around 800 million travel trips will be made during the eight-day Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day holidays which will kick off on Friday. With record demand for travel and the sustained economic impact of the Asian Games, this year's Golden Week holidays are poised to become the most vibrant and prosperous in recent memory.As an important window to observe economic vitality, the upcoming Golden Week holidays will lead a significant consumption rebound in the fourth quarter, playing a crucial role in driving economic growth throughout the entire year, experts said.Despite downward pressure due to multiple factors, China's consumer market is currently displaying signs of recovery and growth. The resilience, potential, and dynamism of consumption remain strong and unchanged, experts said, refuting Western media and politicians' bearish outlook on Chinese economy.Latest data on holiday travel, accommodation, and tourism products all pointed to a stark rebound from the levels seen in 2019, indicating a remarkable resurgence in consumption activity.Wednesday marks the first day of the Golden Week holidays travel rush. The railway network in the Yangtze River Delta region is expected to deliver more than 2.5 million passenger trips on Wednesday, 600,000 above the 2019 level, representing growth of over 30 percent, according to China Railway Shanghai Group Co.According to the China Tourism Academy, over 100 million travel trips will be made per day during the Golden Week holidays, far surpassing the levels of last year and 2019. In terms of commercial aviation, more than 21 million travelers will take flights in the span of eight days and an average of 14,000 domestic flights will be operated per day, up 18 percent from the same period in 2019. China Railway Group forecast that 190 million railway trips will be made during the holidays, up from the 138 million trips seen in 2019.Hotel bookings for popular destinations have also surged. Data from Qunar showed that domestic hotel bookings for the holidays have increased by 514 percent compared to 2019. Outbound tourism is expected to see a 20-fold year-on-year increase , according to online traveling platform Trip.com. Travel agency U-tour predicted the number of outbound travelers would exceed this year's May Day holidays by five folds.According to the National Immigration Administration, the average daily number of inbound and outbound passenger trips during the holidays are expected to reach 1.58 million, three times higher than the same period last year.Additionally, traveling to Hangzhou, East China's Zhejiang Province has become a spotlight and a unique spark for holidays spending as the eight-day holidays coincide with the main competition days of the Hangzhou Asian Games which last from September 23 to October 8.

Data from the online travel platform Fliggy shows that during the Asian Games, international flight bookings bound for Hangzhou have surged 20 times compared to the same period last year. Train ticket bookings have recorded a 4.7 times year-on-year growth, and hotel bookings near venues have increased by three times compared to last year. The other five cities in the province co-hosting the games also experienced a boom in tourist numbers.With a substantial surge in bookings for flights, train tickets, accommodations, and tourism products, this holidays break is expected to unleash further consumption potential which vividly illustrates the positive trajectory of the Chinese economy, experts said.In light of record booking and travel data, indicating a growing consumption enthusiasm, Tian Yun, a Beijing based economist attributed the growth to the lengthier holidays break and spill-out effect of events like the Asian Games, which have injected energy into the economy.

Accelerator of economic growth in Q4



Experts predict that thanks to effective macroeconomic stimulus policies and the boost from the Golden Week holidays, consumption will bounce back strongly in the fourth quarter, playing a crucial role in driving economic growth for the entire year. They have also dismissed smear and bearish outlook painted by some foreign media and Western politicians about the Chinese economy.



China's retail sales, a main gauge of consumption, beat expectations in August thanks to a bumper summer travel peak and consumption-boosting measures, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed.



Driven by the accelerated sales of travel and a wider range of spending options, retail sales of consumer goods in August recorded a year-on-year growth of 4.6 percent to 3.79 trillion yuan ($521.13 billion), 2.1 percentage points higher than the growth rate in the previous month, according to the NBS.



Experts said that the Golden Week holidays and the Asian Games will further accelerate the consumption recovery and economic growth in the fourth quarter, expecting more policy tools to kick in. In addition, the Belt and Road Summit in October and the China International Import Expo in November will both provide a strong boost to China's economy and development.



The extended holiday period provides a significant opportunity for a retail spending peak and is expected to have a significant impact on the GDP growth in the fourth quarter, acting as ""an accelerator,"" Cong Yi, a professor from the Tianjin University of Finance and Economics, told the Global Times on Tuesday.



The Asian Games in particular will be a major boost for consumption-related sectors from sports and culture to catering for the host city and nearby cities in East China's Zhejiang Province as well as the Yangtze River Delta region, Cong added.



According to media reports, citing official information from Zhejiang Province, the preparations for the Asian Games between 2016 and 2020 are estimated to have added about 414.1 billion yuan to Hangzhou's economy, accounting for 7.6 percent of the city's total economic output during that time. It also led to an increase of around 103.3 billion yuan in government revenue, which is about 8.2 percent of the total revenue collected. Additionally, the Games has created job opportunities for approximately 670,000 people, accounting for 2.4 percent of the total employment during that period.



The consumption vitality generated by the Hangzhou Asian Games extends far beyond Hangzhou, with the ripple effect gradually emerging in various parts of Zhejiang Province and even the entire Yangtze River Delta region.



During the Asian Games, hotel bookings in Ningbo, Wenzhou, Huzhou, Shaoxing, and Jinhua cities have all increased by more than fivefold compared to 2019, with Shaoxing experiencing the highest growth rate of 720 percent in hotel bookings.

Beyond the tourism, the sports craze sparked by the Asian Games has ignited the sports economy, sports manufacturing and foreign trade. According to customs data, the export of sports goods from Yiwu, East China's Zhejiang Province reached 5.08 billion yuan in the first eight months of this year, a year-on-year increase of 33 percent.Tian said that the sustained success of the Asian Games and other major events this year will continue to further drive not only domestic consumption but also international consumption, presenting a window for China's opening-up.Expert noted that China's consumption potential remains untapped and a massive household saving indicates a significant market for emerging consumer goods and upgraded consumption needs.By the end of August, the balance of savings deposits for urban and rural residents in China exceeded 7 trillion yuan for the first time, standing at 7.06 trillion yuan.More can be done to stimulate the consumer market, Tian said, pointing to upgraded consumption demand and new consumption drivers.New-energy vehicles, domestically produced 5G smartphones, domestically produced large aircraft, and the cruise economy will all become new growth points for China's consumer economy, Tian said.He is confident that with the government's efforts, the gradual recovery of individuals from the pandemic's impact, the retail sales growth could reach 6 percent in the fourth quarter.""It is expected that macro policies will focus on creating more jobs and promoting economic growth in the fourth quarter. It will also address long-term issues like aged care to boost market confidence,"" Tian said.

Li Yong, president of Chongqing Frontier Regional Economic Research Institute, told the Global Times that stimulating consumer spending through the issuance of shopping vouchers is a good method, especially for the catering and tourism sectors, which will encourage people to visit malls and take trips. Experts also defied attacks by some Western politicians and media outlets that paint the Chinese economy as being at the cusp of collapse.Cong dismissed smear from foreign media, as the trend of consumption upgrading in China's massive market of 1.4 billion people remains unchanged. He also noted that the bearish view on the Chinese economy is a long-standing line of attack from sections of the Western media, yet it has never managed to drag down China's economy.""China is well on track to achieve the GDP growth target of around 5 percent for the whole year, and the final quarter growth will solidify the target,"" Cong said.Tian predicted China's economic growth to grow at around 5.2 percent for this year.""Actions speak louder than words. As China remains focused on its economic work, progressing at its own pace and avoiding empty rhetoric, there is no need to pay attention to Western attempts to discredit it,"" Li said, predicting China's economic growth would finish in a range of 5 percent to 5.2 percent this year.

Steph Predicts Luka ‘On Precipice’ of Major Accolades,Steph Predicts Luka ‘On Precipice’ of Major Accolades,"When it comes to NBA accolades, Dallas Mavericks star Luka Doncic already has a handful of them on his mantle, including several monster playoff performances and four consecutive All-NBA First Team selections.

However, Doncic, who is only 24 years old, still has a lot of room to grow, as he’s yet to accomplish two of the biggest goals an NBA player can reach: league MVP and a championship.

On Monday, Golden State Warriors four-time champion Steph Curry joined former NBA player Gilbert Arenas’ show, “Gil’s Arena,” to talk about a variety of league topics. In the “Who’s Got Next” segment of the show, Curry had some big praise for Doncic, and made a prediction about his near future.

“Luka’s like the guy, obviously, that’s right on the precipice of all those accolades,” Curry said. “Just what he’s about as a player. [It’s about] that threshold of just, ‘how do you crack through?’ I hope it’s not now, but when you play against him, you can feel it”

Coming into his sixth season, Doncic appears to be in the best physical shape of his young career. He still has some international business to attend to before putting his entire focus on the 2023-24 NBA season, as he prepares for the FIBA World Cup with the Slovenian national team, but after that, all bets are off.

Not only did the Mavs re-sign Doncic’s co-star in Kyrie Irving, but they upgraded the depth around the star duo as well with the additions of Grant Williams, Seth Curry, Richaun Holmes, Dereck Lively II, OMax Prosper, Dante Exum and Derrick Jones Jr. Dallas did all of that while also retaining key roster pieces from last season like Josh Green, Jaden Hardy, Maxi Kleber, Tim Hardaway Jr. and Dwight Powell.

Curry predicts Doncic as being the next star to ‘run the league,’ so to speak, and the Mavs’ front office has given its superstar a better chance of doing just that after this offseason. We’ll see how the on-court results materialize in a few months.

China Business Law Awards 2023,China Business Law Awards 2023,"China Business Law Journal reveals its top performing law firms of 2022

The trajectory of China’s economic growth followed a clear V-shaped path for the past year – a harsh descent followed by a rebound. On a bumpy road to recovery, the world endured so much in 2022. There were legal efforts behind every rise and fall of the curve that helped market players better prepare for what was coming their way.

As we selected the winners of this year’s China Business Law Awards, we were proud to witness law firms maximising their potential to expand business scope and depth, optimising management structure and enhancing service capabilities, all while operating in the fiercely competitive environment of China’s legal market.

Alongside the economic downturn, law firms faced elevated regulatory challenges. For instance, intermediaries are bearing heavier obligations as China implements a nationwide IPO registration system. Given mounting risks in capital market deals, some law firms have opted for business transformation and have made significant breakthroughs elsewhere, such as REITs, antitrust, corporate compliance and data protection.

Rising to the challenges, legal service providers keep increasing their clients’ reach, globally and in-country, by setting up new offices in key cities such as Tokyo, Madrid, Los Angeles, Sao Paulo and Singapore. They are also bringing in experienced talent to maintain or build their competitive edge.

As always, we conducted extensive research and evaluation to accurately identify the top-performing firms in each field for 2022. In months of collecting law firm submissions and soliciting industry feedback, we received hundreds of submissions and thousands of comments from corporate executives, in-house counsel and senior practitioners. The selection process was entirely fee-free.

To ensure fairness and accuracy, candidate firms were evaluated mainly through three sources of analysis: their own submissions; endorsements from client referees; and valid nominations from the industry. Internal nominations were invalid. In addition to peer nominations, we received selections from government institutions, the judiciary and academia.

This year, the China Business Law Awards continue to adopt the same categorisation as previous years’ awards. They are divided into three types: general awards; practice area awards; and industry sector awards. In principle, each category award is given to eight Chinese law firms and eight foreign law firms. However, to accurately reflect trends in market development, this year we expanded the number of winners to 10 law firms for certain categories.

The general awards include the Golden League, best international law firms, best offshore law firms, firms to watch, notable achievers and pro bono achievers.

The 22 practice areas are: anti-bribery & anti-corruption; asset management; banking and finance; capital markets (domestic); capital markets (overseas); competition and antitrust; corporate compliance; data protection and data privacy; dispute resolution (domestic); dispute resolution (international); employment and labour; government and public affairs; IP (copyright); IP (patent); IP (trademark); international trade; M&A (inbound and domestic); M&A (outbound); private equity and venture capital; restructuring and insolvency; structured finance and securitisation; and taxation.

The 15 industry sectors are: automotive/industrials and manufacturing; aviation; construction and infrastructure; consumer and retail; education; energy and natural resources; family wealth management; fintech and blockchain; healthcare/pharma and life sciences; insurance and reinsurance; internet and e-commerce; media/entertainment and sports; real estate and REITs; shipping; and technology and telecoms.

It is worth noting that these awards are presented to law firms with a broad range of services and national recognition. In response to the rapidly growing Chinese legal market, a separate “China Business Law Awards (Regional Awards)” will provide a more granular look at the achievements of regional branch offices and local firms. The results will be published in an upcoming issue.

This report only includes some of the winners’ achievements and market testimonials due to space limitations. We must emphasise that each of the winning law firms under each category is equally outstanding. And we applaud all our winners for their exceptional performance.

The winners of the Golden League, our most prestigious award for Chinese law firms, are (in alphabetical order): Commerce & Finance Law Offices; Haiwen & Partners; Han Kun Law Offices; Jingtian & Gongcheng; JunHe; King & Wood Mallesons; Tian Yuan Law Firm; and Zhong Lun Law Firm.

Haiwen & Partners, with more than 30 years of experience in a broad range of areas serving high-end clients, has handled major transactions despite a gloomy global capital markets environment. The firm was Chinese legal counsel for China Mobile’s return to the A-share market, helping the company raise RMB56 billion (USD7.8 billion) on the SSE, the highest for an IPO in nearly a decade.

Haiwen also acted as Chinese counsel for the issuer, China Duty Free Group, in its HKD16.2 billion (USD2.1 billion) IPO, the largest in the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong in 2022. The firm represented lithium battery maker Gotion High-tech as one of the first Chinese companies to issue global depository receipts and list on the SIX Swiss Exchange.

Haiwen has also fully demonstrated its expertise in the fiercely competitive field of M&A. The firm participated in influential transactions such as Danfoss China’s sale of its orbital motor business, Fibocom Wireless’ acquisition of 51% equity of Rolling Wireless, and Ping An Healthcare’s acquisition of 100% equity of Scientia Smart Health Technologies.

JunHe continued to participate in many significant projects in 2022, including: acting as the issuer’s counsel for Haichuang Pharmaceutical in its Star Market listing on the SSE, making it the first company in southwest China to apply for an IPO under the bourse’s fifth set of IPO standards; assisting chemical company INEOS in signing three major deals with Sinopec worth USD7 billion; and helping GAC Aion raise RMB18.3 billion in its series A financing.

Leveraging its robust legal service capabilities and integrated management structure, JunHe targeted organisations with emerging environmental, social and governance (ESG) business frameworks in 2022.

It established a specialised department comprised of 13 partners and several dozen lawyers and certified ESG consultants who focus on three core areas: ESG and EHS (environment, health and safety) compliance; green and low-carbon services; and green finance. They provide comprehensive legal services related to ESG to enterprises across various industries. Within less than 10 months, the firm was honoured with the “ESG Legal Service Firm of the Year” award by the British Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.

Among the clients of King & Wood Mallesons (KWM) in the field of data protection are three companies leading in their respective industries: Agricultural Bank of China (ABC); China Everbright Bank; and TravelSky Technology.

While advising ABC, KWM worked with a consulting firm to interview stakeholders of more than a dozen business lines and more than 100 information systems. Based on the interview results, KWM helped ABC map out personal information processing activities and conducted a compliance gap analysis against relevant jurisdictions’ applicable laws and regulations.

After the due diligence process, the firm provided detailed and practical suggestions to assist ABC in its cybersecurity and data compliance obligations, including but not limited to reviewing and revising privacy documents, business agreements and informed consent forms, establishing and optimising internal compliance policies, and providing internal training on data protection.

Tian Yuan Law Firm reached the milestone of its 30th anniversary in 2022, and established new offices in Wuhan and Nanjing. The firm also handled several highly complex transactions and cases in a wide range of areas.

Tian Yuan has received extensive recommendations from peers and regulators in its antitrust practice. Lu Yan, development research centre director of the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), China’s antitrust watchdog, says the firm is “professionally excellent and worthy of recommendation”. In addition to representing clients in merger control filing cases in the tech sector handled by the SAMR, Tian Yuan also participated in the watchdog’s discussions on relevant projects.

Last year, Zhong Lun Law Firm saw significant progress in its newly established business departments, and maintained its lead in the domestic capital market.

The firm’s compliance and government regulatory affairs department, which was set up just two years ago, grew rapidly in 2022, assisting many enterprises in establishing compliance systems, effectively responding to crises, and resisting potential regulatory and litigation risks.

The debt restructuring and non-performing asset disposal business that Zhong Lun has been focusing on very recently has also met market demand last year, completing several industry-influential projects and helping enterprises overcome difficulties.

Allen & Overy Baker McKenzie Clifford Chance DLA Piper Freshfields Kirkland & Ellis Latham & Watkins Skadden

The winners of the best international law firms stand out for their extensive scope of practice and outstanding legal services in China. They provide high-quality local legal services to businesses with Chinese elements through their global network of offices and qualified international lawyers.

Among the earliest foreign law firms to venture into China, DLA Piper offers a comprehensive range of legal services to clients operating in or connected to China. The firm refined its expertise in various areas in 2022 including asset management, IP, construction and infrastructure, real estate investment and REITs, fintech and blockchain.

Statistics by capital markets data company PitchBook have shown DLA Piper ranked second globally in 2022 for its number of private equity deals, advancing one position from the previous year. The firm has remained dedicated to innovative thinking and delivering efficient solutions amid evolving economic, political and technological settings, to help clients succeed in a highly competitive market.

DLA Piper completed some initial fintech projects including advising Hong Kong private company Calcite on Asia’s first tokenisation of private debt on the Hedera enterprise-grade public ledger. The firm also enhanced corporate compliance by utilising various technologies to identify potential risks and detect compliance breaches. In IP, the firm implemented technology to expedite the calculation of trademark application costs with rapid accuracy.

Freshfields’ outstanding performance in China last year reflects its commitment to global services. The firm’s expertise in anti-bribery and anti-corruption, corporate compliance, capital markets, antitrust, M&A, restructuring and insolvency has enabled Chinese companies to navigate the complexities of investing overseas and expanding their global footprint.

Furthermore, Freshfields’ in-depth knowledge of Chinese regulations and business practices has not only allowed the firm to effectively advise foreign companies on doing business in China, but also bridge the gap between Chinese and overseas businesses.

The firm was a leader in the capital markets last year. After the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong launched a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) listing regime, Freshfields acted on the first SPAC listing in the city, and advised on the listing of China Tourism Group Duty Free’s HKD16.2 billion (USD2.07 billion) Hong Kong IPO, the largest of its kind in 2022.

The firm was also involved in a cross-listing enabled by the China-Switzerland Stock Connect programme, through which Chinese lithium-ion battery maker Sunwoda Electronic listed its global depository receipts (GDR) on the SIX Swiss Exchange.

In the area of corporate compliance, Freshfields has been a reliable adviser on regulatory and litigation challenges, particularly US sanctions. The firm’s experience in handling complex compliance issues spans areas such as sanctions and export controls, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, national security, criminal law, data protection and IP.

Kirkland & Ellis wins 12 awards across practice areas and industry categories. Despite the global economic downturn, the firm achieved global revenue growth of nearly 8%, to USD6.5 billion last year. With one of the largest PE teams in Asia, Kirkland focuses on complex leveraged buyouts and other M&A, private investment in public equity and JV.

Last year, the firm’s Hong Kong office hired PE and M&A partner Peng Yu, whose key clients include Alibaba, Bain Capital and BPEA EQT (formerly Baring Private Equity Asia). One of his major transactions last year was Nexus Point Capital’s leveraged acquisition of freight-forwarding company Honour Lane Shipping.

Brian Ho, a former corporate finance executive director at Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), also joined Kirkland’s transactional group as partner in its Hong Kong office last year. Ho was dedicated to regulatory duties for 27 years, and was chief co-ordinator of the SFC to launch the China-Hong Kong Stock Connect scheme. His addition significantly strengthened the firm’s connectivity to Hong Kong and the mainland in capital markets.

Latham & Watkins has built a strong presence and reputation in China. The firm has close local connections and relationships with Chinese regulators, government agencies and business leaders, which enables it to provide clients with valuable insights and guidance on navigating the Chinese legal and business landscape.

In the realm of securitisation, Latham focuses on complex and bespoke derivatives and structured products rather than low-margin, high-volume transactions. With a dedicated equity-linked and equity derivatives practice in Asia, Latham is uniquely positioned to provide insight into complex US legal issues that often arise in these types of transactions. The Greater China team is also well equipped to advise on the structuring of emerging products related to climate, longevity and property derivatives.

In 2022, Latham’s restructuring and insolvency team in Greater China had their busiest year as they advised creditors and troubled companies on some of the most high-profile transactions. These included the USD6.2 billion debt restructuring of Hong Kong Airlines and the restructuring of Huachen Energy’s USD500 million senior notes in the US, which was the first PRC reorganisation plan recognised under chapter 15 of the US Bankruptcy Code.

These winning law firms have impressed their clients – and the larger legal market – in facilitating complex listings and transactions in offshore markets, most prominently Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands (BVI) and the Cayman Islands.

Conyers participated in 28 Hong Kong IPOs in 2021 and 2022, accounting for about 25% of the market. As BVI and Cayman legal counsel, Conyers advised in the HKD143 million (USD18.3 million) listing of Vanov, the HKD364.6 million listing of Readboy Education, and the HKD125 million global offering of Buyang International on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK). It also acted as special legal counsel to InnoCare Pharma on its pioneering red-chip listing on the Star Market, raising more than RMB2.9 billion (USD407 million).

Furthermore, Conyers acted as Cayman counsel to Hop Hing Group on its HKD228 million privatisation and subsequent delisting from the SEHK, and advised Hong Fok Land International on Bermuda law in its HKD150 million privatisation by a scheme of arrangement. The firm also served as a special counsel in Bermuda to Shuifa Singyes Energy in its non-public offering of RMB1.5 billion in green bonds, due in not more than five years, on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.

Global offshore firm Harneys has a full-service team in mainland China, with its Shanghai office doubling in size in 2022. The firm acted as BVI counsel to Studio City in its issuance of USD350 million five-year senior secure fixed-rate 7% notes due in 2027, and to TSMC Global in the issuance of notes for an aggregate principal of USD1 billion, despite a series of US Federal Reserve interest rate hikes that significantly pushed up borrowing costs.

Harneys was engaged as Cayman Islands counsel to Luckin Coffee in its provisional liquidation proceedings and holistic restructuring of liabilities, including its USD460 million convertible senior notes and USD175 million settlement with its Nasdaq-listed ADR purchasers.

Loretta So, a Shanghai-based partner at KPMG, praises managing partner Vicky Lord and partner Calamus Huang, from Harneys’ Shanghai office, for their legal and fiduciary assistance to mutual clients. “[They] are very proactive in organising networking events for professionals and fund managers, and are very generous in sharing industry insights with clients who are new to the Shanghai asset management sector,” she says.

Maples Group acted as BVI and Cayman Islands counsel on a wide spectrum of capital market transactions in Asia, including pre-IPO financings, IPOs, dual listings and follow-on offerings. The firm provided legal services to Bain Capital in its acquisition of VXI Global Solutions from Carlyle Group and, in July 2022, advised on the dual primary listings of OneConnect Financial Technology, Tuya and MINISO Group on the SEHK.

Maples also advised on high-profile multi-jurisdictional insolvency cases such as the restructuring of Evergrande’s USD20 billion offshore debt; and the restructuring of Modern Land’s USD1.34 billion bondholder debt.

Lung Tin Law Firm provided IP defence and brand protection services to companies in information technology, media and communication, retirement and healthcare, recreation, energy, logistics and many other industries. The firm represented Lian Hwa Foods Corporation in its lawsuit against Huafei Food for producing and selling products that infringe the “Cadina卡迪那” registered trademark, in which it provided valuable reference to subsequent penalties by supplying evidence of the detailed amount of illegal turnover. The Beijing Administration for Market Regulation selected the case as one of its 10 exemplars of IP enforcement for the year.

Lung Tin further participated in many significant copyright cases such as an infringement and unfair competition dispute between Tencent and a short video platform. This case tackled several highly contesting issues such as algorithm-based recommendations, a platform’s copyright liability and the boundary of the “safe haven” provision.

With offices in Beijing and New York, Yuanhe & Twelve Tables provides intellectual property, financing and dispute resolution services to clients such as Baidu, Tencent, Kuaishou, Perfect World and Mihoyo. The firm is the result of a merger between Yuanhe Partners and Twelve & Table Law Firm, both IP specialists, in May 2022. Continuing its trajectory of scaling up while doubling down on IP expertise, Yuanhe more recently signed an agreement to gradually merge with Vcan Intellectual Property Law Firm.

Hui Ye Law Firm operates 35 offices domestically and internationally. In 2022, it added a new office in Xiamen. Since 2021, the firm has expanded its teams with the recruitment of more than 300 lawyers, meaning that more than 30 offices across the country experienced increases in personnel. Particularly notable expansions have occurred in the Shanghai, Beijing, Chengdu, Xi’an, Lanzhou and Ningbo offices.

Reinforcing its talent pool has led to an overall improvement in the firm’s capabilities in multiple practice areas. For instance, its asset management team, which also focuses on dispute resolution, has achieved remarkable results in the past three years. The team consistently achieved an annual business and performance growth rate of more than 50%, and have represented on numerous influential matters including the case of Fuguiniao bonds’ misrepresentation of liability.

Last year, Jincheng Tongda & Neal welcomed the addition of more than 20 senior partners, strengthening the firm’s expertise in various areas including capital markets, real estate, construction engineering, dispute resolution and intellectual property. Alongside talent acquisition, the firm has actively focused on building its brand by engaging in public legal education activities, contributing to the preservation and dissemination of intangible cultural heritage, and selecting and publishing its “Top 100 Cases” since its establishment, which serves as a valuable resource for professional research.

In the past year, Jincheng Tongda & Neal has demonstrated exceptional performances in numerous significant transactions including the issuance of the first batch of RMB40 billion (USD5.58 billion) perpetual bonds by China Construction Bank in the domestic market. Others include ESR acquiring logistics and industrial assets from DLJ for RMB4.4 billion, and several Chinese solar companies quashing an Indian anti-dumping investigation.

Kangda Law Firm is among the earliest of the large comprehensive law firms approved by China’s Ministry of Justice, with offices in 21 cities nationwide. Last year, the firm expanded its presence by adding offices in Chongqing, Hefei and Ningbo, while also increasing its roster of practising lawyers by more than 10% to exceed 1,300 professionals.

During the same period, Kangda provided legal services for numerous domestic and international companies engaged in investment and financing transactions, with deal values reaching tens of billions of renminbi. Noteworthy deals included the pioneering issuance of Swiss GDRs by A-share listed companies, and the country’s first midwestern free trade zone (FTZ) offshore bonds for foreign investors.

Sundial Law Firm expanded in 2022, adding 24 lawyers and 10 partners. The firm also established a marital & family affairs and wealth succession professional committee.

D&S Law Firm demonstrated a strong commitment to social responsibility through public welfare activities in 2022. It offered D&S scholarships at Wuhan University, South China University of Technology and South China Normal University, and founded the D&S Hope Primary School in Guigang village, Guangxi. In addition, the firm financially supported underprivileged students in Da’er and Kemuwan, two rural villages in Guangdong, providing them with opportunities for development and a brighter future.

Jin Mao Law Firm actively provided legal aid for the protection of women’s and children’s rights, and participated in community governance. A notable initiative last year was the co-operation between the firm’s Asian women’s group, JM-Lady, and the Shanghai Women’s Federation, a local chapter of the All-China Women’s Federation. The group offered advice and lectures on general law, covering topics such as family disputes and the protection of minors and the elderly.

SGLA Law Firm, through its Western Legal Services Brand Innovation Centre, offers legal support to ethnic minorities and is committed to understanding ethnic affairs and related laws.

Additionally, the Chengdu Xiangrui Minority Legal Aid Service Centre – established by Juheng Law Firm, which has merged with SGLA – assisted in 113 legal aid cases and resolved 96 conflicts and disputes.

Last year, Davis Polk’s Hong Kong office undertook a range of projects such as providing legal representation for asylum seekers and refugees in relation to non-refoulement claims, work permit applications, and unlawful detention claims at both the initial and appellate levels. The firm also advised social enterprises and charities on matters of corporate governance, contractual and regulatory compliance, as well as due diligence.

Gide’s Shanghai-based partner, David Boitout, led a legal workshop in collaboration with Plan International China, an international humanitarian development agency. The workshop focused on the employment rights and interests of young women, covering topics such as types of employment contracts, social insurance policies, statutory rights and benefits for young women under labour laws, common labour disputes and their settlement mechanisms.

Ropes & Gray’s China team worked with the International Legal Foundation (ILF) to advise on the alignment of Myanmar’s proposed anti-trafficking law with international human rights laws. Given the intricate and sensitive nature of the topic, the firm’s China team also conducted training for ILF staff in Myanmar to facilitate the promotion of the anti-trafficking bill.

Ropes & Gray was also actively involved in LGBTQ-related activities with the aim of creating a diverse, equitable and inclusive community. As part of this effort, the firm provided pro bono legal counsel to Out Leadership, a pro-LGBTQ business networking organisation.

PRACTICE AWARDS

Haiwen & Partners boasts an exceptional anti-bribery and anti-corruption team, spearheaded by Beijing-based partner Yang Jianyuan. The team successfully handled numerous cases and established compliance systems for several Chinese companies listed in the US and Hong Kong, in relation to their investment ventures and high-profile bankruptcy proceedings.

In particular, the team conducted thorough anti-corruption due diligence for a multibillion-dollar investment across several industries. It meticulously analysed the impact on investors, taking into account China’s anti-corruption laws and the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. It identified several severe anti-corruption risks in the target companies, leading the clients to suspend some investments. Additionally, the team assisted the clients with post-investment compliance management and recommended corrective actions for several of the targets.

Global Law Office represented several industry associations in 2022, preparing anti-corruption and anti-commercial bribery standards, and recording training courses for them. For example, multiple national industry associations, including the China Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industry Association, invited the firm’s compliance team to help prepare the anti-commercial bribery sub-clause of China’s first industry compliance standard, the Pharmaceutical Industry Compliance Management Code.

Eric Dai, chief compliance officer of Chery Jaguar Land Rover, lauds his company’s longstanding collaboration with Global. He commends Li Jiajie, the firm’s Shanghai-based partner, for his careful and meticulous approach, his ability to think from a different perspective, and his capacity to quickly identify the legal essence of various types of domestic and overseas compliance risks issues, and provide corresponding solutions.

“Li is particularly noteworthy for his ability to provide feasible and practical compliance advice based on a comprehensive understanding of our business needs, which effectively safeguards the legal rights of clients,” says Dai.

Jin Mao Law Firm investigated and prosecuted anti-corruption and white-collar crime cases for numerous multinational corporations, and provided legal services for establishing and optimising internal compliance frameworks.

In 2022, Jin Mao conducted an investigation for Panasonic to determine whether a senior executive had any conflicts of interest during employment with the company. Panasonic has a substantial number of suppliers but the Jin Mao team managed to narrow the investigation to a few key suppliers by leveraging publicly available databases, avoiding unnecessary work and saving costs. Ultimately, the team successfully cleared the executive of suspicion within a short period of time.

Pinsent Masons’ white-collar crime and corporate investigations practice has grown rapidly in recent years, advising Chinese companies including large state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and central enterprises on multilateral bank investigations, and providing them with tailored compliance plans and policies.

A client SOE in the nuclear power sector describes Pinsent Masons as “an outstanding practice in the area of internationalisation of operations and integrity and honesty compliance … able to provide a quality service”.

The SEO also recommends the firm’s Beijing-based partner, Zheng Feifei, and praises her team’s “ability to listen effectively to clients’ needs and provide a bespoke service”.

Shearman & Sterling’s entire anti-bribery and anti-corruption team is fluent in Chinese, enabling its members to review original evidence and speak to witnesses in their native language when conducting investigations, resulting in better quality information and savings for clients.

Alex Parker, global head of special investigations at GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), says he was very satisfied with Shearman & Sterling’s service. “They have been longstanding and supportive partners with a deep understanding of our business model and global values,” he says.

He also pays special tribute to Jieni Ji, a counsel in the firm’s Hong Kong office. “Jieni has provided myself and the team with outstanding support, going the extra mile to support the business,” he says.

H&T Law Firm was active in handling various non-litigation asset management projects involving a combined investment of more than RMB50 billion (USD7 billion) in 2022. The firm also played a significant role in various litigation and arbitration cases related to distressed asset management, with a total value exceeding RMB60 billion.

Several major asset management projects were also successfully tackled, including: a RMB2.6 billion relief project in collaboration with China Cinda Asset Management and a listed company; a RMB4.36 billion asset package project for CITIC Bank; and the acquisition of RMB4.1 billion worth of non-performing bonds from China Minsheng Bank.

JunZeJun Law Offices notably represented Aviva-Cofco Asset Management in a successful lawsuit renowned as the first domestic insurance fund debt scheme to be recovered by way of litigation. Aviva-Cofco had served as trustee of an insurance funds debt scheme providing RMB2.5 billion in financing to Wuhan CBD. Oceanwide Holdings acted as guarantor of the financier.

However, on the maturity of the financing, Wuhan CBD failed to pay RMB1.3 billion of the remaining principal and corresponding interest, and Oceanwide Holdings did not discharge its joint and several liabilities.

“JunZeJun Law Offices has extensively studied the field of asset management and accumulated significant experience, giving us professional services in both non-contentious and dispute resolution,” says Camille Guan, in-house counsel for risk compliance at Aviva-Cofco.

Merits & Tree Law Offices provided legal advisory services for Minmetals International Trust’s No.2 funding trust, part of its Hengxin Rixin investment offering of various debt products such as bonds, principal-protected notes and securitisation products with a total size exceeding RMB17 billion. Unlike drafting legal documents for individual projects, legal services for such compound portfolios require a careful balance between managing legal risks and commercial concerns. The success of this product made it one of the signatures offered by Minmetals International Trust.

DLA Piper focuses on assisting clients to establish hedge funds, private equity funds, tokenisation funds and hybrid funds. Among these in 2022, the firm provided legal guidance to Tianyan Capital – which manages RMB30 billion of Chinese assets – in launching two different hedge funds through single-legged master-feeder fund structures. DLA Piper also advised CITIC Capital on its fund restructuring and consolidating/merging of asset management business with CLSA Asset Management.

Ropes & Gray’s asset management team in Hong Kong, led by managing partner Vincent Ip, acted for the world’s largest institutional investors in relation to their private equity, hedge fund and separate account investments, as well as secondary market and co-investment transactions.

Global Law Office helped Haitong Unitrust successfully sign the first environment and social governance-linked (ESG) syndicated loan in Shanghai’s financial leasing industry, which structurally broke the usage restrictions and pricing mechanism of traditional green credit, allowing for the innovation of green finance. The firm’s clientele includes several domestic and foreign banks, international multilateral banks and various other financial institutions.

JunHe specialises in handling a wide range of complex structured transactions. Most notably, in 51job’s take-private offer from the Nasdaq, JunHe assisted the financing syndicate to design the privatisation financing structure.

This extended from negotiating, drafting and amending the loan agreement and other financing documents to assisting various banks in implementing specific agreements in the financing documents for credit approval, and issuing legal opinions, transaction memoranda and other legal documents.

The firm also provided legal support to different overseas branches of the Bank of China in connection with the granting of several financing facilities to DITO Telecommunity, the third-largest telecoms service provider in the Philippines.

King & Wood Mallesons (KWM) acted as PRC counsel for Xiamen Port Investment Operation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Xiamen Port Holdings Group, in the privatisation of Xiamen International Port by way of a merger by absorption.

A total of six partners provided solutions on corporate, securities, financing, tax and other related legal matters. The transaction was notable as the first privatisation of a Hong Kong-listed company in the port industry with a state-owned enterprise background.

KWM also advised BNP Paribas Asset Management on its joint venture with a wealth arm of the Agricultural Bank of China. On the completion of the transaction, the French company’s 51% stake in the new company made it the fifth international bank majority-owned Chinese wealth management joint venture.

Sidley Austin advised on many innovative financing transactions, including private equity R-Bridge Healthcare Fund striking a USD40 million royalty-backed financing for Yisheng Biopharma, the first deal of its type in China’s biopharmaceutical industry. According to Sidley Austin, lack of market precedence in the biopharmaceutical field added to the complexity in tailoring a royalty deed compatible with Yisheng’s tax requirements.

The firm also advised real estate developer Shimao Group on its offshore debt restructuring aimed at safeguarding the value of assets in Tai Wo Ping, Hong Kong. A critical aspect of the project was to differentiate the restructured loans from Shimao Group’s overall offshore debt and protect them from the impact of the whole debt restructuring, while at the same time navigating property mortgage requirements of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and land grant restrictions.

Slaughter and May, with a focus on green finance, acted for several major banks in Hong Kong, mainland China and Asia on more than HKD30 billion (USD3.83 billion) of ESG/sustainability-related loans. One highlight was providing support to the Link Real Estate Investment Trust in obtaining HKD12 billion in sustainability performance-linked loans from 16 domestic and foreign banks. This transaction was the second-largest of its kind in 2022 in the Asian real estate industry as well as the REIT sector.

Slaughter and May was also involved in: China Power International Development’s RMB7.5 billion (USD1 billion) acquisition of clean-energy projects from its parent, state-owned State Power Investment, the most significant action in Hong Kong’s clean energy market in nearly a decade; and a string of deals valued at USD7 billion between Sinopec and INEOS, advising on majority equity and financing issues.

AllBright Law Offices sustained its leading position in the domestic capital market in 2022. Based on publicly available data from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) and A-share stock exchanges, AllBright provided services to 50 out of 427 new A-share listings and 70 from 526 under the permitted process by the CSRC, ranking first among law firms in 2022 in terms of both the number of listed companies and number of passed-through companies.

Commerce & Finance Law Offices was involved in a number of major domestic IPOs last year, including the share swap and merger of Hong Kong-listed China Energy Engineering Corporation with A-share listed Gezhouba Group, which was the first H-share listed company to merge with an A-share listed company – and the largest in recent years – involving a combined market value of more than RMB120 billion (USD16.8 billion).

The firm also acted as legal adviser to Ningbo Zhoushan Port and sponsor CICC in the RMB24.8 billion private placement between China Merchants Port Holdings, Ningbo Zhoushan Port and the Zhejiang Provincial Seaport Investment & Operation Group.

DeHeng Law Offices conducted several types of transactions in capital markets in 2022, including IPOs, refinancings, bond projects, debt financing instrument projects and private fund manager registration projects. The firm notably advised oil giant China National Offshore Oil on PRC law in the RMB28.1 billion listing on the main board of the SSE, with fundraising increased by RMB4.2 billion after an over-allotment option was fully exercised. This deal was the second-biggest A-share offering in 2022, and also a large-scale listing project after China expanded a pilot scheme to allow red-chip companies to list their shares domestically.

Haiwen & Partners played a crucial role in one of the most important transactions on the A-share market last year by advising on PRC law for the listing of China Mobile Communications on the main board of the SSE.

Inclusive of the over-allotment option, the final transaction size reached RMB56 billion – the largest A-share listing project in the past decade – and the issuer became the first red-chip corporation on the main board of A-share exchanges.

King & Wood Mallesons was also included in the heavyweight transaction by acting as PRC counsel to the joint sponsors, CICC and CITIC Securities. Assistance on other major listing projects included Jinko Solar’s secondary listing on the Star Market. The IPO raised RMB10 billion, ranking it fifth in China’s capital markets in 2022.

Zhong Lun Law Firm marked a significant milestone in the domestic capital markets in 2022 as the first law firm to write an IPO prospectus for Fortune Precision Equipment on the Star Market. It has previously been customary for brokerage firms to pen prospectuses in the A-share market, unlike overseas markets, where lawyers usually write prospectuses.

However, the change in rules of the mainland capital markets to align with those overseas has spurred law firms to participate in the prospectus writing process, and this development is likely to mark the beginning of more such changes in the future.

The firm also advised on the first backdoor listing on the SSE’s Growth Enterprises Market since changes in the rules on reverse takeovers, with a transaction size of RMB19.6 billion.

Han Kun Law Offices has provided capital markets legal services to many Chinese companies amid increased scrutiny from US regulators on Chinese concept stocks, including advising Chinese EV maker NIO on its Hong Kong and Singapore listings by way of introduction, and its USD2 billion American depositary shares secondary issuance, as well as helping KE Holdings on its Hong Kong listing by way of introduction.

As China introduced several regulations related to data security in the past year, Han Kun also advised on PRC data security law in Leapmotor’s Hong Kong listing, the first law firm to act in such a role for a company successfully listed on the HKEX.

Wu You, senior legal manager of Hong Kong-listed Autohome, praised Han Kun for “always being the first to share the interpretation of new rules when they are released, so that we can understand the impact on the company and put forward the reaction plan from a practical point of view”.

JunHe’s capital markets team – the largest specialist team within the firm comprising more than 60 partners, along with consultants and hundreds of associates – was PRC counsel to Atour Lifestyle Holding’s Nasdaq IPO, a symbolic ice-breaking deal easing China and US capital market tension.

Although preparations for the transaction began in 2020, the external regulatory environment in the US had since changed significantly, as China announced six new rules regulating overseas public listings, requiring JunHe to continually adjust work plans and resource allocation.

Jia Yuan Law Offices advised on two of the top three IPO offerings in Hong Kong last year, including the largest, the HKD16.2 billion (USD2 billion) IPO of China Tourism Group Duty Free, and the third-largest, the HKD10.1 billion listing of China Aviation Lithium Battery.

Latham & Watkins helped one of the world’s top suppliers of rechargeable battery components for EVs, Tianqi Lithium, to debut on the HKEX as the second-largest share sale in 2022. In addition to capital markets transactions, the firm also worked with the HKEX on the new listing regime and provided legal suggestions, reflecting the regulator’s recognition of the firm.

Skadden specialises in advising Chinese companies on de-SPAC listings in the US capital markets. Highlights of last year’s transactions include: automotive technology company ECARX, valued at about USD3.82 billion, after its combination with a SPAC; and Hong Kong unicorn Prenetics, with an equity valuation of USD1.25 billion, when the de-SPAC was completed.

The firm also advised NaaS Technology, a Chinese EV charging service provider, on a reverse takeover merger with US-listed RISE Education Cayman. Unlike a typical SPAC merger, RISE was defined as a “public shell” by Nasdaq as it sold all its assets at the end of 2021.

Jingtian & Gongcheng advised Conch Cement on antitrust matters in relation to two major transactions last year. The first transaction involved its joint acquisition with Shangfeng Cement of a stake in the Uzbek-Chinese joint venture Shangfeng-Bridge of Friendship, in which Conch Cement ultimately held a 51% stake.

Another transaction involved Conch Cement’s acquisition of a controlling stake in Conch Environmental Protection. Both transactions met the filing requirements of the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), and Jingtian & Gongcheng was instrumental in handling related matters securing approval for the transactions.

Tian Yuan Law Firm handled various types of antitrust matters in 2022, including antitrust litigation heard by the Supreme People’s Court, dozens of merger filings, antitrust investigations from different countries, as well as more than a dozen undeclared filing investigations for clients in the internet, private equity funds and other sectors.

Some of the firm’s notable cases included representing the Chinese academic database, CNKI, in response to an anti-monopoly investigation initiated by the SAMR, as well as its involvement in the first civil dispute relating to patent and anti-monopoly in the field of active pharmaceutical ingredients, which involved RMB100 million in dispute.

Zhong Lun Law was appointed to represent the Guangdong Administration for Market Regulation after 13 concrete enterprises were penalised for joint price increases in Maoming, Guangdong, and appealed and filed anti-monopoly administrative proceedings. Similar events were staged in the motor vehicle testing industry in Huizhou. Both cases responding to the lawsuit were eventually won and selected among 10 typical anti-monopoly cases issued by the Supreme People’s Court in 2022.

Eversheds Sutherland advises and defends the Hong Kong Communications Authority in antitrust-related judicial reviews on a year-round basis, with clients also including the Hong Kong Competition Commission, Cathay Pacific Airways, China National Petroleum Corporation, New World Development and Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group.

The chief counsel of competition at a leading industrial technology company, is highly satisfied with Eversheds Sutherland’s competition and antitrust service, and particularly recommends the firm’s partner, Jocelyn Chow, as “a rising star in her field”.

Slaughter and May advised INEOS on a number of antitrust transactions in China over the past year, including a string of joint venture and equity acquisitions valued at USD7 billion with Sinopec, and the 50% stake acquisition in Sinopec’s Tianjin Nangang Ethylene Project. Given that both INEOS and Sinopec are global petrochemicals groups, these projects garnered significant attention from the SAMR.

The firm also played an important role in assisting a subsidiary of Swire Group with the acquisition of its remaining 50% interest in Sino-Ocean Taikoo Li Chengdu from the Sino-Ocean Group for RMB5.56 billion (USD779 million), and the acquisition of six subsidiaries of Coca-Cola Bottlers Manufacturing on the mainland.

Dentons China has extensive experience in building corporate compliance systems. In 2022, the firm helped Haier Smart Home and a Chinese state-owned tobacco company to construct systems that ultimately led to their ISO 37301 certification. This global standard, set by the International for Standardisation, allows certified companies to tap additional marketplace opportunities.

Dentons China also provided customised compliance solutions to rapidly evolving external influences. For instance, the firm analysed the sanctions and regulatory policies of major countries in response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and provided compliance risk management services to China National Petroleum Corporation and its foreign-based subsidiaries.

Last year, Global Law Office assisted official departments and industry associations with their compliance systems. The firm provided legal advice on compliance and risk control to the Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, and advised the Guangming District People’s Procuratorate in Shenzhen on its corporate compliance rectification and supervision project. After being invited by multiple national industry associations, including the China Pharmaceutical Industry Association, Global Law Office participated in drafting the first industry compliance standard in China to promote pharmaceutical industry development.

Chery Jaguar Land Rover’s chief compliance officer, Eric Dai, commends the firm’s compliance counsel Jenny Chen for her ability to accurately grasp cutting-edge information and provide quality legal advice and support.

Amid the central government’s heightened focus on compliance, 2022 was designated as the “Year of Strengthening Compliance Management” for state-owned enterprises. Jincheng Tongda & Neal lent its expertise to the likes of the State Development & Investment Corporation, China SDIC Gaoxin Industrial Investment Corporation and China Poly Group Corporation, helping them construct effective compliance mechanisms.

This involved creating meticulous lists of compliance obligations, risks, job duties and process controls. The company also assisted with compliance process mechanisms for specialised areas like investment, capital and procurement.

The Asia corporate risk and government investigations team at Latham & Watkins worked with regional partners to enable companies to respond to the increasing rigours of global enforcement. The team, which includes Beijing partner Xu Hui, Tokyo partner Kaede Toh, Hong Kong partner Simon Hawkins and Singapore partner Farhana Sharmeen, has particular experience in financial compliance through regular interactions with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Singapore Stock Exchange.

In 2022, Steptoe & Johnson witnessed growing interest from Chinese companies seeking projects funded by multilateral development banks (MDBs), leading to a significant increase in related compliance advice. To meet this demand, the firm provided multi-jurisdictional legal counsel to Chinese clients on regulatory compliance and dispute resolution strategies, ensuring clients could demonstrate robust measures for preventing MDB compliance breaches.

Steptoe & Johnson also received increased enquiries around restrictive US sanctions lists, particularly about violations issued by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control and the US Department of Justice.

Security assessment of outbound data was one of the most important tasks in the construction of the domestic cybersecurity and data compliance regime in 2022.

DeHeng Law Offices was commissioned by the National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team, a subordinate unit of the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), to act on two new rules: the Measures for Data Export Security Assessment; and the Regulation on the Standard Contract for Export of Personal Information (draft for comment).

As a legal adviser to the Beijing Winter Olympic Organising Committee, East & Concord Partners offered comprehensive services on data compliance matters. With the Winter Olympics being among the most significant global sporting events, the firm delivered solutions to data-related issues in compliance with Chinese laws and regulations, as well as managing conflicting data protection laws from different jurisdictions while addressing concerns about cross-border data flows.

The firm was invited by the Cyber Security Association of China, the subordinate association of the CAC, to draft the first group standard in China for assessing the data compliance of investees in their investment and financing activities.

Watson & Band drafted a series of institutional design and regulatory documents for the Shanghai Data Exchange and provided advisory services to the China Advertising Association on implementing personal information protection. Given the many organisations involved in internet advertising, and the difficulty of obtaining consent from individuals for many data processing tasks, the firm contributed to a guideline for the advertising industry to remove potential compliance risks.

Bird & Bird has a team of specialised privacy and data protection experts who provide advisory services to high-profile companies that frequently gather and transfer vast amounts of sensitive data. This team is well-versed in Chinese data protection law, and some of its lawyers are qualified to practice under the EU, UK and Hong Kong laws.

The firm welcomed protection and privacy partner Wilfred Ng’s return last year. Previously, he worked as senior legal counsel at Tencent’s international privacy and data protection department.

Foreign law firms mainly advise international companies on navigating their China operations. DLA Piper advised InterContinental Hotels Group, Hilton and Shangri-La on privacy and cybersecurity in greater China. As new data protection regulations were being implemented in Asia, including China, Thailand and Singapore, global jeans brand Levi’s appointed the firm as privacy counsel to review the company’s internal data privacy programme.

Grandall Law Firm acted for the defendant, the lead underwriter, in the first domestic infringement dispute concerning short-term financing bonds issued by the National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors, which is the self-regulatory body of China’s interbank market.

The case was complicated by the defendant’s multiple roles, as both the lead underwriter of the short-term financing bonds in question and the issuer’s financing bank, as well as purchasing and selling these products with investors. The effective judgment ultimately exonerated the defendant from all liability.

The dispute resolution practice committee of Hiways Law Firm consists of more than 40 partners and 300-plus lawyers and paralegals. The firm acted on behalf of Kehua Bio-Engineering, a listed company, in a series of cases amounting to RMB10.5 billion (USD1.5 billion) in 2022.

These cases involved contract disputes, shareholders’ right to know and property preservation compensation disputes, with Xi’an Tianlong Technology, Suzhou Tianlong Biotechnology and three shareholders as defendants. Hiways successfully facilitated a full mediation between the parties, removing the client’s risk of delisting and safeguarding the interests of nearly 80,000 investors.

China Enterprises’ in-house counsel, Zhang Liu, recommends Hiways’ senior partner He Qiang, saying the multiple perspectives offered by his diversified roles – a university master instructor, consultant to the Supreme People’s Procuratorate and an arbitrator – “can not only pinpoint the crux of a case but also accurately judge its direction and outcome, guiding clients to make the right choice and maximise their business interests”.

As one of the largest departments at Kangda Law Firm, the dispute resolution department represented more than 8,500 cases and generated more than RMB750 million in revenue last year, accounting for more than 55% of the firm’s total revenue.

Kangda achieved a victory for one of its high-profile clients last year after a challenging four-year legal battle. In the case, which involved the unauthorised use of professional Go player Nie Weiping’s portrait for commercial promotion, Kangda represented three parties: Nie Weiping, as the plaintiff for infringement of personality rights; Nieqi Shengyuan Culture Development, as the trademark owner for infringement of trademark rights; and Yiyou Go Culture, as the plaintiff for unfair competition, in suing Zhenpu Education Technology Development. The firm eventually successfully defended the plaintiffs’ rights.

In another notable case, the firm secured the support of an arbitration tribunal on jurisdiction, subject matter, contractual validity, and powerless agency in an equity acquisition dispute with LeEco, on behalf of a film and culture studio in Shanghai.

TianTong Law Firm focuses on providing high-end commercial dispute resolution services and offers clients legal advice throughout the entire process of litigation, arbitration, enforcement and bankruptcy. More than 40 cases represented by the firm have been published by the Supreme People’s Court, covering case filing, commercial and civil trials. Some have been established as guiding cases for civil and commercial trials.

Last year, Hui Zhong Law Firm’s three partners served as presiding arbitrator, sole arbitrator, and side judge in 12 international arbitration cases. Some of the firm’s lawyers acted as Chinese legal expert witnesses in nine international arbitration cases and one English court litigation.

In 2022, the firm represented a Singaporean company in an international arbitration case against an Asian country. The company claimed the Asian country breached its treaty obligations under the Agreement on the Promotion and Protection of Investments with the Singapore government by revoking seven of the company’s local land use rights certificates without compensation. The case is still in negotiation.

Jincheng Tongda & Neal (JT&N) has many partners and associates who served as arbitrators and board members of arbitration institutions such as the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre and the Asian International Arbitration Centre in Malaysia. Its clients included the Ministry of Commerce, Country Garden, and Yancheng Shanda Yuanfeng Equity Investment Partner.

In January 2022, Shanda Yuanfeng sought recognition and enforcement of a Chinese court judgment in the US. JT&N, along with US counsel, successfully convinced the US District Court for the Central District of Illinois that Shanda Yuanfeng’s motion met the requirements of the Illinois Uniform Foreign Judgment Recognition Act. The court ultimately issued a summary judgment in their favour, making this one of the few cases where a valid Chinese judgment has been recognised and enforced by a US court.

Latham & Watkins was selected to serve for three years on the Ministry of Commerce’s law firm panel for international trade and investment disputes involving international investment law and foreign law firms.

Leveraging expertise in advising Chinese companies on cross-border litigation matters, Latham & Watkins was retained to represent Sinovac Biotech in a dispute involving dissenting shareholders who contested the company’s control. The legal proceedings spanned multiple jurisdictions, including the Antigua High Court and the Antigua Appellate Court, as well as venues in Massachusetts, Delaware, Hong Kong and Beijing. The firm finally secured a victory for its client at trial.

Skadden specialises in assistance to Chinese clients mired in complex securities litigation in the US. The firm provided counsel to a major classified advertising platform, 58.com, on a shareholder dissenting appraisal action under the Cayman Islands Companies Act that was slated for a hearing before the Grand Court of that jurisdiction. This is the highest-value section 238 case heard in the Cayman courts.

As one of the leading partners of the Asia dispute resolution team, Steve Kwok, prior to joining Skadden, was the resident legal adviser for the US Department of Justice at the US embassy in Beijing, where he represented the US government in working with Chinese law enforcement authorities to investigate criminal activities, particularly corruption, money laundering and fraud. He is experienced in advising Chinese issuers in the dismissal of securities class actions in US courts.

Jingtian & Gongcheng’s labour and employment team has more than 20 partners and lawyers in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Chengdu. Some have also worked in relevant enterprises and institutions for many years and are familiar with the relevant practice areas.

Yoki Hui, the senior human resources manager of greater China at jewellery brand Chopard, says: “Apart from being familiar with domestic employment and labour laws, [the law firm] provides a lot of practical and professional legal advice in labour dispute cases and [is] meticulous in sorting out evidence to protect the best interests of clients.”

LongAn Law Firm recorded a 19% year-on-year increase in labour dispute cases in 2022. This achievement included 34 non-compete cases, 47 cases of trade secrets, and eight complex large-scale labour relations adjustment cases out of the covid pandemic.

LongAn boasts two members serving as advisory experts on labour law aspects of civil cases at the Supreme People’s Procuratorate, while four others are arbitrators on the labour personnel dispute arbitration commissions in various cities.

Noteworthy is the capability of the firm’s labour team to navigate through disputes arising from non-compete clauses. These disputes frequently pose challenges in obtaining adequate evidence of these crucial contractual provisions. LongAn collected convincing evidence by way of follow-up filming, notarisation and access to associated companies, leading to successful judgments and client satisfaction.

As consciousness regarding the defence of women’s rights increases, disputes over workplace sexual harassment have gradually come to the fore. In one dispute between Leo Pharma in Shanghai and an accused former employee, River Delta Law Firm helped the pharmaceutical company to diminish its financial losses by more than RMB600,000. The legal team also successfully averted the dismissed employee’s request for work reinstatement. The case lasted five years and was ultimately won during the second instance in court, after losing during the initial labour arbitration and the first court hearing.

Last year, many companies changed their growth strategies or adjusted their internal rules following Hong Kong’s regulatory overhaul. When a company relocated its Asia-Pacific headquarters from Hong Kong to Singapore, Deacons advised on some of the sensitive personnel changes required to facilitate the relocation.

Similarly, when another client mandated vaccinations for staff working in its hotel, laundry, catering and private club segments, the firm assessed the legal boundaries of the new law and assisted in communication with staff on the controversial subject.

As Chinese labour laws undergo changes, Morgan Lewis provided more legal advice on matters such as executive compensation, employee benefits, international secondments and expatriation.

The firm was appointed by a global life sciences group to handle a case arising by a former senior executive for unpaid equity grants. This employee then encouraged eight other recently dismissed colleagues to bring similar claims. Morgan Lewis successfully persuaded the arbitrators and judges in three Chinese cities that the cases were not employment contract disputes and obtained judgments in favour of the client.

The firm says the win was crucial to the client as hundreds of people may potentially have brought claims if the case had been lost.

Boss & Young Attorneys-at-Law has facilitated the strengthening of the foundational position of competition policies for a number of governmental and administrative authorities. Engaged by the Management Committee and the Market Supervision Bureau of the Lingang New Area in Shanghai, Boss & Young reviewed and advised on the fair competition perspective of 46 policies and proposals.

As a third-party agency, the firm provided post-assessment services of administrative documents for a number of district governments, including those of Huangpu and Jiading districts of Shanghai, as well as evaluations on the necessity to renew expiring normative documents.

As the perennial legal counsel of the National Railway Administration (NRA), DOCVIT Law Firm provided services in the areas of administrative legislation, review and litigation, and legal argumentation for major decisions.

Wang Shuo, of the technology and rule of law division of the NRA, reserves particular praise for Xue Zheng, senior partner at DOCVIT. Xue has represented the NRA in more than 20 lawsuits, so far without losing a case. “Xue is a veteran in governance and administrative law,” says Wang. “He is capable of capturing clients’ needs and providing multi-layered, multidimensional legal services.”

In January last year, DOCVIT saw further reinforcement to its governance strength by merging with Dare & Sure Law Firm. Administrative law and compliance happened to be one of the strongest suites of Dare & Sure.

In the past year, Hui Ye Law Firm held a strong presence in many administrative disputes concerning the energy, real estate and education sectors. One licensing dispute involved the 50-year exclusive franchise rights of Jingrong Pipeline Gas based in Ganyu, Lianyungang in developing local gas projects. The case was heard in four courts. In view of the granting of duplicate franchising rights by the local government, Hui Ye helped the company file a petition for invalidation of the administrative act, touching on both inconsistency between local laws and sector regulations, and the priority of the court.

Since its establishment in 2019, the government and administrative law department of Kangda Law Firm has demonstrated remarkable performance. According to the search results of Alpha, an online legal intelligent operating system, Kangda comes up on top after filtering cases of representing Beijing administrative authorities for “administrative” cases.

Dorsey represented a Taiwan-based conglomerate and its mainland China subsidiary in matters pertaining to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) and expert control advisory, clearing the path for its major reorganisation and IPO on the SSE. It also represented many foreign-invested entities of multinational enterprises in dealing with a great variety of government investigations in mainland China, local government dawn raids, tax inspections, environmental inspections and other government driven inquiries. The firm achieved zero to low-penalty results for all these matters.

“Dorsey lawyers excel in their expertise of both Chinese and US laws, as well as their problem-solving skills,” says a legal director of a leading multinational pharmaceutical company. “Their attention to detail and strong commitment give clients confidence on their work quality.”

Hiways Law Firm lent its expertise to Kankanews Network, producer of East 110, a Shanghai-based legal TV programme. Realising that PPTV, a video platform operated by SynaCast Media Tech, was streaming East 110 without its authorisation, Kankanews launched a copyright infringement lawsuit. In addition to securing the infringement evidence, Hiways pinpointed the amount of illegal gains based on views on PPTV, its published advertising rates and CPM (cost per mille) calculation. The court supported in full Kankanews’ claims for compensation of more than RMB1 million.

For many years, Shanghai-based Mengquan Trading has been the exclusive retailer for Zuny, a Taiwan home decor brand, in mainland China. It discovered that a company named Weilegu Infotech, founded in Qingdao, was selling products on Taobao and other platforms subject to Zuny’s copyright. For this case, it sought the services of Landing Law Offices, which successfully helped prove the infringement of the respondent. When the judge found it difficult to determine an amount, Landing supplied the key supporting material in the form of a licensing agreement signed between Mengquan and an unrelated third party, which substantiated the contribution of copyright and trademark rights to profits from infringement.

Ren Chaohui, general manager at Mengquan Trading, is satisfied with the IP services and professionalism of Landing, reserving a special recommendation for Bill Gao, senior partner at the firm’s Shanghai office. “Our company has entrusted Gao’s team with many IP protection and counterfeiting cases, all of which ended in a favourable judgment,” he says.

In the first civil case before the Beijing Internet Court against an online English education organisation for the unauthorised online usage of textbooks, Lusheng Law Firm helped McGraw Hill, one of the world’s largest educational publishers, secure compensation of RMB3 million. Evidence collection was tricky as the case involved textbooks and content contributed by many authors and editors, which was further complicated by the defendant’s argument of fair use.

TransAsia Lawyers serves many reputable clients in the entertainment industry, such as Jackie Chan, film director Zhang Mo, and Legendary Entertainment. The firm advised Storycom, China’s leading sci-fi content creator, on its key transactions and licensing deals with a number of top Chinese sci-fi writers. It also advised China Film Group on numerous film projects such as Moon Man, Ordinary Hero and The Wandering Earth 2.

China’s patent market is brimming with a momentum of growth, benefiting from a nationwide drive in R&D and a collective increase of IP awareness. According to the China National Intellectual Property Administration, the total number of effective invention patents in China in 2022 reached 4.2 million, of which 3.3 million were held by inventors from mainland China, making it the first country to pass the three million threshold.

Saelink Law secured a victory for VMI, a Netherlands-based producer of tyre manufacturing machinery, in a series of patent ownership disputes with a Chinese company, turning the matter around from a loss at the first-instance hearing. In the series of patent infringement and invalidation disputes between a world-leading semiconductor and chip company and MediaTek, Saelink represented the former and successfully invalidated four patents on the competitor’s side, leading to a settlement.

“Saelink, especially Chen Wenxuan and his team, works extremely fast,” says Eddy-John Franziskus, general manager at WKV, a German engineering company engaged in flue gas cleaning technologies. “They have developed a deep understanding of our technology and business, even deeper than some licensees using the technology for many years.”

Wanhuida Intellectual Property is the first choice for IP protection in China of many pharmaceutical heavyweights. In two separate cases, it helped Sanhome Pharmaceutical in defending the validity of its patents of medical uses for a chiral drug in administrative litigation, and defeated two patent infringers in two instances of court proceedings. In the case of the latter, Wanhuida secured favourable court decisions, cessation and damages of RMB800,000.

In addition, the firm secured favourable administrative decisions from the Nanjing IP Office for Bayer in a patent administrative enforcement action against two Chinese infringers offering for sale the client’s patented drug, rivaroxaban, at exhibitions and websites. The Supreme People’s Court used this case to clarify several complex issues, such as whether offering for sale hinges on the availability of the product.

Zhong Lun Law Firm represented a number of tech companies in patent invalidation. When Global Innovation Aggregators, a subsidiary of iPEL that is a US non-practising entity, filed a series of patent lawsuits against Netgear’s Chinese subsidiary, Zhong Lun mounted a multi-pronged defence by questioning the plaintiff’s right of action and patent validity, as well as making infringement comparisons. Eventually, the cases ended with withdrawal by the plaintiff, ineligibility of the plaintiff and invalidation of the patent.

Zhong Lun further helped JCET, the third-largest semiconductor packaging and testing enterprise in the world, to launch a series of IP lawsuits against Forehope Electronic, a Ningbo-based fellow player in the semiconductor sector. The lawsuits, in response to Forehope’s alleged poaching of JCET employees, included trade secret infringements, patent ownership disputes and patent invalidations. After successfully invalidating two patents, the parties reached a settlement in September 2022.

According to Ropes & Gray, about 75% of the firm’s IP workflow is dedicated to the life sciences sector. Last year, the firm advised Everest Medicines in a commercial agreement with Accelerate Technologies for products related to covid-19, and with Gilead Sciences for the development of the cancer drug Trodelvy in Asia for up to USD455 million. It also represented LianBio in a commercialisation agreement with Pfizer for rights to develop and commercialise sisunatovir, an antiviral treatment for the respiratory syncytial virus, in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Singapore.

Steptoe, meanwhile, has continued to represent high-profile clients in China such as Huawei, Autel Robotics and Anycubic Technology. In particular, it defended SF Diamond, the largest manufacturer of polycrystalline diamond (PCD) cutters and related products in China, from accusations of patent infringements lodged by US Synthetic. After a global search of PCD cutters not manufactured in the past decade, the Steptoe team, led by Timothy Bickham, a partner based in both Washington and Beijing, proved the asserted patents invalid.

Steptoe also represented Hisense in a multiple-patent lawsuit filed at the US International Trade Commission by Philips, focusing on Hisense’s smart TV products. The patents related to the digital rights management technology used in many lines of consumer products around the world. In the end, the administrative law judge determined that Hisense’s products did not infringe the asserted patents.

An Tian Zhang & Partners (ATZP) represented Syngenta, a leading agricultural company, in a successful civil lawsuit against a business that used the brands “Syngenta” and “先正达” on fertiliser packaging, as well as the shop that sold the products. The infringement was judged unfair by the court, which also supported the firm’s argument that fertiliser is a “similar good” to a pesticide, under which Syngenta’s prior trademark was registered.

Chen Yixian, a barrister and solicitor at Toronto-based law firm Jones & Co, is happy with ATZP’s services. “We have been working with the firm for more than 10 years and their services have always been great,” she says. “They listen to clients’ needs and provide tailored advice.”

Jincheng Tongda & Neal (JT&N) made a significant contribution in trademark protection last year. After finding out that the defendant Chongqing Shengbaili Waterproof Building Materials used “劳亚尔” as its product trademark, JT&N represented one of the plaintiffs Chongqing Jiushengcheng Waterproof Material, co-filed a lawsuit with another plaintiff in the Chongqing First Intermediate People’s Court, arguing that Shengbaili’s actions infringed their long-registered trademark “劳亚尔” and constituted unfair competition, which was supported by the court. The case was selected by the Supreme People’s Court (SPC) as one of the 50 exemplary intellectual property cases in 2021.

JT&N also assisted overseas companies in defending their rights in China. Another company in 2007 and 2010 had applied to register the Peruvian company Cantol’s primary trademark, “CANTOL”, in China. Even after trying to defend its rights for more than a decade, Cantol remained unsuccessful until the company enlisted JT&N’s help, which ultimately led to their victory in court.

Wanhuida Intellectual Property acted in three high-profile trademark disputes, including assisting Manolo Blahnik winning a long copycat trademark battle in China, representing Milan Wedding Photography in its trademark “Milan” acquiring secondary meaning through extensive use, and the Stahlwerk OEM (original equipment manufacturer) trademark infringement, all of which were named by China Business Law Journal as the among the Deals of the Year 2022.

In the Manolo Blahnik case, Wanhuida represented the famous Italian designer in a retrial before the SPC and obtained a favourable decision. Blahnik successfully invalidated through the proceedings that the registration of the trademark “MANOLO&BLAHNIK (马诺罗·贝丽嘉)” filed in class 25 by a Chinese squatter in 1999, based on the designer’s name rights and the bad faith of the registrant, putting an end to a 22-year trademark battle. The decision will pave the way for Manolo Blahnik’s entry into the Chinese market.

Chance Bridge Law Firm assisted two Chinese companies in responding to anti-dumping investigations. In March 2022, Indonesia’s Ministry of Finance announced anti-dumping duties for imports of hot rolled coil of other alloy products from China. With the help of the international trade and compliance team of Chance Bridge, Taigang Stainless Steel obtained a final tariff of 8.6%, a steep drop from the 16.6% in the preliminary ruling.

Last July, India’s Ministry of Commerce and Industry made a disclosure prior to the issuance of a final ruling related to anti-dumping investigations for the import of resin bonded thin wheels from China, under which Zhejiang Xinbao Industry & Trade, advised by Chance Bridge, obtained a satisfying result of zero margin of injury, which means no duty was levied.

King & Wood Mallesons provided legal support to the Chinese government in a WTO-arbitrated dispute that began in 2012, when China lodged a complaint to the WTO about US-imposed countervailing duties on certain Chinese imports such as solar panels. According to the latest WTO ruling, China can retaliate against a total of USD645 million worth of annual US exports by imposing tariffs. This is the sixth-highest retaliatory amount to date for the WTO, and the second time China has won such a ruling against the US.

JunZeJun Law Offices acted as legal counsel for China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) in another high-profile WTO dispute regarding China’s claims that the US, citing national security reasons, imposed illegal tariffs on steel and aluminium products from China and elsewhere. The case sent ripples affecting USD13 billion worth of the global aluminium trade, as well as 35 million tonnes of the global steel trade. In December 2022, the WTO panel ruled that the US tariffs in question did violate WTO rules and did not qualify for the national security exception.

Additionally, JunZeJun’s trade relief team advised Risen Energy on anti-dumping and countervailing review, customs verification, retrospective investigation and trade remedy issues regarding the US and other regions. Li Zhigang, the company’s chief legal officer, highly commends the team’s professionalism and results. “Not only have they fought for all time low rates in the industry, and sometimes even zero tariffs, they have also helped us secure the lowest separately approved rates in the country,” he says.

Pillsbury’s offices in China and the US work together to provide around-the-clock services to clients on export control and sanction matters. The firm advised multiple companies on the China tariff exclusion process under section 301, including Valmet, Victaulic and KONE, resulting in exclusions granted and significant tariffs reduced. It also acted as the US export control and sanctions adviser to Leapmotor, an electric vehicle manufacturer, in its USD807 million listing on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong.

Steptoe was involved in numerous high-profile and difficult trade disputes between China and the US, covering anti-dumping and countervailing duty trade remedies, customs and WTO dispute resolution.

Selected by the MOFCOM for the international trade panel, Steptoe advised the ministry on a number of complex trade cases and assisted in the panel proceedings regarding China’s anti-dumping measures on stainless steel products from Japan. It also acted as overseas legal counsel in the above-mentioned steel and aluminium tariff dispute.

He singles out David Boitout, the partner in charge of Gide’s practice in Asia, as a highly skilled M&A professional. “[Boitout and his team] are capable of being proactive for suggesting relevant scenarios and alternatives to complete deals in China at the best conditions for their clients,” says Lacroix.

AllBright Law Offices acted as counsel and an administrator in the pre-reorganisation and reorganisation of Jiangxi Firstar Panel Technology and its core subsidiaries, marking the first reorganisation of a listed company in Jiangxi province, as well as the first regional application of pre-reorganisation. The reorganisation plan was approved by the court in August 2022.

AllBright also served as the administrator in the personal bankruptcy settlement proceedings of Zhang Yuansheng, which ended with the debtor and creditor reaching a settlement, a first in a personal bankruptcy case in mainland China. This was a significant development for the further promotion of this much-anticipated procedure.

As an administrator, JunHe took part in the RMB37.1 billion substantial consolidation and bankruptcy reorganisation of Dongying Fangyuan Nonferrous Metals, along with 19 related entities, the plan of which was approved by the court.

In a dispute on an application to revoke repayment to an individual creditor, JunHe represented the respondent, a provincial branch of a state-owned bank, which ended with the court dismissing all claims of the opposing administrator, including revocation of a previous repayment to a client.

Merits & Tree Law Offices served as sole legal counsel in tranches 1 to 3 of Jiangsu Jinnong’s small loan debt-backed securitisation, the first small loan ABS product under the principal-agent model.

Could a pandemic destroy an economy? Iran and the Black Death,Could a pandemic destroy an economy? Iran and the Black Death,"As the world copes with COVID-19, one of the biggest issues surrounding the pandemic relates to the economic damage that has been caused. What will the long-term consequences be? A look back at the Black Death reveals how even regions that were not hard-hit by the plague would find themselves suffering other repercussions.

The recent article “The Impact of the Black Death on Iranian Trade (1340s-1450s A.D.),” by Ahmad Fazlinejad and Farajollah Ahmadi tells the story of how that region lost its position as an international trade hub because of a pandemic. This was not because of population losses in Iran, but rather because the Black Death was so destructive for their trading partners.

The thirteenth century has been considered a golden age when it came to international trade and the rise of global connections. The rise of the Mongol Empire helped to facilitate trade over the Silk Road, allowing goods from China and India to reach Europe. During this period, Iran, and particularly its southern coast benefitted as a trading hub. The city of Hormuz was the leading port of the region, having established seaborne networks with India and China to the west, and Yemen and Africa to the south. Travellers to the city praise its economic vitality – for example, Marco Polo writes about Hormuz:

Merchants come here by ship from India, bringing all sorts of spices and precious stones and cloths of silk and of gold and elephant tusks and many other wares. In this city they sell them to others, who distribute them to various customers through the length and breadth of the world. It is a great centre of commerce, with many cities and towns subordinate to it, and the capital of the kingdom.

One of its most important connections was with the city of Tabriz, located in present-day northern Iran. It served as the capital of the Mongol state known as the Ilkhanate, which ruled a vast territory in the Middle East and Central Asia between the 1250s to 1330s. It also was the home for many European traders, particularly Genoese, who would facilitate the passage of goods from Iran to the Black and Mediterranean seas, and ultimately to the ports of Europe.

In their article, Fazlinejad and Ahmadi note several recorded instances of European travellers passing through Iran before the mid-fourteenth century, either for business or religion. However, with the fall of the Ilkhanate in 1335, and political disorder in their former territories afterwards, these travels declined.

The outbreak of the Black Death, between the years 1347 to 1352, would see many parts of Eurasia suffer disastrous population declines. Moreover, the bubonic plague would return in the years afterwards – Fazlinejad and Ahmadi observed ten more major outbreaks between the first pandemic and the year 1450. Iran itself would be struck by the plague – chroniclers report, for example, that 300,000 people died in Tabriz between the years 1369 to 1370, However, the article also reveals that one part of the region seems to have been largely spared:

What is remarkable about the Black Death outbreaks in Iran is that since the beginning of the spread of the disease until the middle of the 15th century, no report has been found in the historical sources about the plague in the Persian Gulf coasts and ports. The only available information is about the outbreak of plague in Sistan in 1347, which has been reported by the 16th-century Persian historian Malik Šāh Ḥusayn Sīstānī. He says that the inhabitants of Sistan suffered much from the plague, but there is no evidence indicating the spread of the disease to the Persian Gulf coasts.

While the Black Death did not seemingly cause huge losses in the population of Hormuz and other parts of southern Iran, it still devastated their economies over the long term. This is because the plague crippled their trade partners, in particular their connections with Europe. Italian merchants simply could not continue their trade networks. The same was true for their connections to eastern Asia, as the port cities of China also declined. Even the local trade suffered during this period.

It would take generations for populations to recover from the Black Death, and for the demand for international trade to return. By then geopolitical changes – namely the domination of the Ottoman Empire over the Middle East and southeastern Europe – meant that European merchants could no longer access the trade corridors through Iran. This left cities such as Hormuz in economic decline, as global business passed them by.

The article “The Impact of the Black Death on Iranian Trade (1340s-1450s A.D.),” by Ahmad Fazlinejad and Farajollah Ahmadi, is published in the journal Iran and the Caucasus. You can read the article through its publisher Brill.

In 2019, King & Wood Mallesons (KWM) embraced the quickly changing environments and adapted itself to national strategies such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). KWM was involved in the four-year-long Pakistan Matiari-Lahore high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission project, which is Pakistan’s first HVDC transmission line.

Later, in March last year, KWM established the KWM Belt & Road Centre for International Co-operation and Facilitation. Apart from Pakistan, its service also reaches out to Turkey, Ukraine and other parts of the world.

KWM also advised on some benchmark deals and cases, with some of them being the first of their kind in the market, including Alibaba’s Hong Kong listing, Huatai Securities using Shanghai-London Stock Connect as the first issuer, and Ant Financial’s obtaining of the first pre-litigation act preservation order from Hangzhou Internet Court.

The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area (GBA) remains a major KWM focus. In May 2019, Shenzhen Investment Holdings completed its offering of special corporate bonds in relation to the construction of the GBA on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, with an offering size of RMB1 billion (US$ 144.5 million). The project marks the official launch of the first GBA corporate bond, on which KWM advised the company.

In China’s busy and fiercely competitive legal sector, talent retention has been on top of the law firms’ agenda. KWM published the Young Legal Talent Development Programme last year for top LLB graduates who are directly pursuing careers in the legal profession.

As a pioneer in law firm internationalization, KWM China has set up nine offices across Europe and the Middle East (EUME), the US and Japan, managed by KWM China as one firm.

In 2019, JunHe celebrated its 30th anniversary. The firm opened a branch office in Hangzhou last year, strengthening its development in the Yangtze River Delta region. In terms of partner hires, JunHe has added Lin Li, a consultant focusing on infrastructure construction and overseas investment and financing, and Phyllis Xu and Ye Yurong, partners in the capital market and M&A financing areas.

In overseas capital markets, JunHe assisted Viva Biotech, Pujiang International Group, China East Education Holdings and many other companies to list in Hong Kong. Among them, Viva Biotech’s public offering was oversubscribed by about 106.92 times, making the company one of the most popular biopharmaceutical companies on the main board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

In domestic M&A, JunHe assisted Harbin Pharmaceutical Group to implement its mixed-ownership reform and commence a tender offer for its two A-share listed subsidiaries. JunHe also represented AXA, providing services for the acquisition of the remaining 50% stake of AXA Tianping Property & Casualty Insurance Company, and making AXA the largest wholly foreign-owned property insurance company in China.

Tian Yuan Law Firm was involved in a number of deals that impacted the market in 2019. In overseas capital markets, Tian Yuan provided Hong Kong listings services for biopharmaceutical companies such as Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group, Jinxin Fertility, and CanSino Biologics, as well as educational companies such as Koolearn Technology. Among them, Hansoh Pharmaceutical’s listing was the largest pharmaceutical IPO in Hong Kong, and Koolearn was the first mainland education company listed in Hong Kong.

Tian Yuan’s competition and antitrust business continues to grow, led by partner Huang Wei. The cases represented by the Tian Yuan team included the anti-monopoly investigation to South Korean SK Hynix DRAM (Dynamic random-access memory) chip, and the anti-monopoly investigation into China Mobile. A legal counsel of a multinational company says that Huang Wei and his team “provided practical plans, highly meticulous and conscientious work. They can address the concerns of business personnel particularly well; a team with such excellent performance is rarely seen and always reassures clients.”

In terms of firm development, Tian Yuan opened a Xi’an branch last year to better serve the needs of clients in Shaanxi province and the rest of western China. Tian Yuan says there were more than 10 partner hires and internal equity partner promotions, and more than 80 associates hires in the firm, with a total revenue increase of more than 30% last year.

Last year marked the 25th anniversary of the establishment of Guantao Law Firm, which opened offices in Fuzhou and Zhengzhou during the year. Last year the law firm added 47 partners, and there are now more than 200 partners in total.

In the construction and infrastructure sector, the projects that Guantao participated in included the Liaoning Lianjiaba 300MW photovoltaic grid-connected power generation project, and the Heilongjiang Binxian 50MW wind power generation project, with project amounts exceeding RMB1 billion.

An energy company’s legal counsel was impressed with the M&A services provided by the firm: “[Guantao] discovered the lack of preliminary procedures in the M&A project on time, and proposed effective solutions by designing transaction documents. The final design of the transaction not only prevented and controlled risks to the greatest extent, but also promoted the smooth development of the project.”

In the field of sports, Guantao has been shortlisted for the “Legal Counsel for 2019-2022” sponsored by the Olympic Games Preparation Office of the Chinese Olympic Committee. In media and entertainment, Guantao served CMGE Technology Group Limited in its listing in Hong Kong.

A managing director at a VC company gives high praise to Cooley and recommends Zeng Xun and Xu Jingyi for their “professionalism, expertise, extensive industry knowledge, and excellent client service”.

“Cooley has demonstrated world class professionalism, exactly what you would expect of a global firm,” says the client. “You can tell from working with Cooley that they have years of experience and a good grasp of the VC industry dynamics.”

The client adds that Cooley can always provide timely and detailed responses. “There were thousands of emails back and forth – with our internal team, each LP, and each of the LPs’ internal and external lawyers. I am pleased and impressed to say Cooley managed every single email, [and] they didn’t miss anything at all.”

PE/VC is among Morgan Lewis’ core practice areas, and its clients include Warburg Pincus, Sequoia Capital, Hillhouse Capital, and Bank of China International.

“Anli Partners is very professional in the field of insurance asset management, and their service is also very good,” says the client. “They always help us to prompt compliance issues and solutions in advance, and provide very professional and sound suggestions in conjunction with relevant cases or judgments.”

Jingtian & Gongcheng assisted in dozens of multimillion-dollar asset-backed securitization projects and trusts for well-known enterprises and financial institutions, including the issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) by Sinar Mas Paper (China) Investment, which is the largest CMBS in China by size.

They advised several major financial institutions including Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange, Export-Import Bank of China, and China Development Bank.

Shearman & Sterling’s team is led by Lorna Chen, who has nearly 20 years of experience in the investment funds practice. She regularly leads discussions with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Securities and Futures Commission on legislative reform affecting PE funds.

SG & Co PRC Lawyers has provided asset securitization-related services to many issuers in the past year including China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, SAIC-GMAC Automotive Finance, and Ping An International Financial Leasing.

Among the projects, the Shanghai Yupei (Group) 2019 phase I asset-backed notes (ABN) project was issued in the national interbank bond market in June 2019. SG & Co acted as adviser to the project, and the size of the issuance was RMB650 million. This is the first logistics real estate commercial mortgage-backed medium-term notes project of the National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors (NAFMII).

Yang Kaiyu, executive director of the retail asset securitization business within the debt financing department at China Merchants Securities, says he is “very satisfied” with the service SG & Co provided, and gives high praise to Lawrence Lu and Wang Bin at the firm. “SG & Co has co-operated well with us in countless credit asset securitization and corporate asset securitization projects since 2016,” he says. “They provide clients with long-term, stable, creative and visionary legal services.”

Jia Yuan Law Offices provided related legal services such as transaction structure design, basic asset verification, and legal documents drafting, for the offering of about RMB60 billion worth of products in 2019. The achievements include the offering of the China Tiesiju Civil Engineering Group’s RMB4 billion phase I of ABN 2019 in NAFMII, and CICC-CRRC Supply Chain Finance’s RMB10 billion phase II asset-backed securitization plan.

A client from China Railway Group says the asset securitization services of the company were mainly provided by Jia Yuan in the past three years. “During the offering of the company’s first receivable debts ABN that is off balance sheet, with revolving structure and no credit enhancement, Jia Yuan was able to fully assist clients in demonstrating the transaction structure, and creatively designed a transaction plan to the company’s request,” the client says.

Zhong Lun Law Firm is a significant player in this sector, and handled more than 100 structured finance projects, including asset securitizations, in 2019. Among them are landmark projects that could set precedents for products of their types, such as China’s first real estate investment trust (REIT) project involving an expressway, the first infrastructure REITS, and the first credit assets securitization project via transaction arrangement of “re-investment plus revolving structures”.

Ashurst’s teams in Beijing and Hong Kong have been working with leading policy banks, investment banks, commercial banks and financial institutions on a variety of matters in this field. Patrick Phua, managing partner of the firms’ Beijing office, has more than 15 years of practice experience, and is a member of drafting groups tasked by various industry associations to prepare industry-standard documentation.

As the Chinese economy enters a period of structural adjustment, the number of bankruptcy and restructuring cases has been increasing. According to Xinhua News Agency, in Shanghai alone, a total of 750 bankruptcy cases were heard in 2019, an 83.4% increase year on year.

Dentons was one of the earliest law firms in China to be involved in non-performing asset disposal, bankruptcy reorganization and liquidation. Led by senior partner Zheng Zhibin, the team participated in the restructurings of Highsee Iron and Steel Group, Amoi Technology, and Northern Heavy Industries Group.

In June 2019, the reorganization plan of HOROC Group was approved in the creditors’ meeting and investors’ meeting, and private company Zhongze Group was introduced as a strategic investor. Due to the influence of industry cycles, the company’s current assets were insufficient to settle short-term due debts, and its debts exceeded RMB30 billion. As a member of the administrator group, Dentons led the entire reorganization process.

Dentons also participated in the restructuring of Yunnan Coal Chemical Industry Group, a large SOE directly under the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of Yunnan province. Due to the economic downturn and production surplus, the company experienced continuous operating losses with an overall debt of nearly RMB70 billion.

Meanwhile, the group had several bonds issued in the open market that were about to trigger default or early payment. Dentons acted as legal counsel to the SASAC of Yunnan at first, and later the administrator of reorganization, resolved the bond issue through an innovative “bond shift” method, and finally pushed the group into a judicial reorganization procedure.

Chen & Co Law Firm, as one of the registered bankruptcy administrators of Shanghai Higher People’s Court, has a team for bankruptcy reorganization and special asset investment formed by lawyers specializing in company law, investment funds, securities law, labour law, real estate law, etc.

Chen Mingxia, the partner who leads the team, previously handled reorganization projects for domestic entities of overseas listed companies, the dissolution of foreign financial institutions, and other liquidation projects. He is currently the vice president of the Shanghai Bankruptcy Law Society.

In January 2019, Hsin Chong Group, one of the oldest construction companies in Hong Kong, filed an application to the Supreme Court of Bermuda to go into provisional liquidation, and got approval. Carey Olsen acted for VMS Investment Group in proceedings before the court to secure the appointment of RSM Corporate Advisory (Hong Kong) as joint provisional liquidators for restructuring purposes over Hsin Chong.

As an offshore firm, Carey Olsen provides services relating to restructuring, reorganization and recovery across offshore jurisdictions of Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands (BVI), Cayman Islands, Guernsey and Jersey.

Stephenson Harwood has one of the biggest insolvency practices in Hong Kong and is working on a number of restructuring and insolvency matters arising from the slowdown in China. The firm acts for the joint provisional liquidators of Shanghai Huaxin Group (Hongkong), and assisted in the sale of assets owned by the company and its subsidiaries, including a portfolio of 10 Hong Kong properties worth about HK$2.8 billion.

In another case, it is acting for CECEP COSTIN New Materials in relation to Hong Kong aspects of provisional liquidation and restructuring.

Haiwen & Partners advised an overseas listed company on possible Chinese tax issues under a “poison pill” shareholder rights plan in 2019.

According to Haiwen, the “poison pill” plan is a rare arrangement in the capital market, and each specific arrangement includes special mechanisms and terms, which creates uncertainty about how the relevant mechanisms and arrangements are handled in tax law. The taxation issues involved in this project included corporate income tax, personal income tax, value-added tax and surcharges.

Hwuason Law Firm combines the specialties of taxation and law. After establishment of the law firm, Hwuason Tax Agent Firm (Huashui TA) and Hwuason Group were also launched.

In early 2019, Huashui TA started the “100 cities and 100 offices” strategy, and has set up more than 50 subsidiaries in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Chongqing, Xi’an, Zhengzhou and other major cities, forming a national service network together with Hwuason Law Firm and Hwuason Institute, the firm’s tax law training institution.

Taxation is one of the dominant practice areas for Tiantai Law Firm. Last year, Tiantai participated in more than 100 tax-related administrative reconsiderations or actions, assisting tax authorities and taxpayers in resolving a large number of tax disputes. The firm also provided nearly 100 lectures on tax law to clients.

Gide Loyrette Nouel’s team provides tax-related advice on a range of transactions, including group reorganizations, M&A, tax planning and structuring, joint ventures and major projects, and project financing. Some European Fortune 500 companies are in their client base from industries ranging from mining and metallurgy to pharmaceutical.

"Speechmatics earns government praise as its third international office

opens in US","Speechmatics has opened its third overseas office, earning praise from the Department for International Trade.

The fast-growing Cambridge company, which uses machine learning to power its speech recognition technology, is now present in Denver, Colorado.

John Milliken, Speechmatics' CEO

It will help it expand further markets such as broadcast media and contact centres, as well as into government, defence and intelligence.

US sales already account for 43 per cent of revenues at Speechmatics, which supplies blue-chip companies such as Adobe to Vonage.

Pieter Knight, strategic sales and business development at Speechmatics, who will head the US sales operation, said: “When you see how Speechmatics is already enabling many US businesses to rapidly build innovative applications, how much growth we have experienced in just the last year and how our technology is evolving, we are already very disruptive in the market. A physical presence in America is the obvious next step for the growth of our US business.”

The Denver move follows its office openings in Chennai, India, last month, and in Brno, in the Czech Republic, in November.

The expansion was powered by an investment of £6.35million in October led by AlbionVC, with IQ Capital and several angel investors following on in the Series A round.

Speechmatics has doubled revenue and headcount in the last year and earned the backing from the Department of International Trade (DIT), which is leading the government’s drive to boost British tech exports in a post-Brexit world.

International trade secretary Liz Truss said: “It’s great seeing innovative UK brands like Speechmatics taking advantage of the golden trading opportunities across the Atlantic, giving Americans access to the best British products.

The Speechmatics studio

“Exporters, importers and consumers across the United States and the East of England have everything to gain from striking free trade agreements around the world with countries like the United States.”

Speechmatics’ technology enables voice to be detected and transcribed in any context in real-time, using neural networks that take account of acoustics, languages, dialects, multiple speakers, punctuation, capitalisation, context and implicit meanings. From TV subtitles to searching for phrases in call centre recordings, CRM to security, and from software to consumer electronics, it has multiple applications.

CEO John Milliken said: “Our growth in the past year is evidence of the burgeoning demand for technology that allows organisations to innovate with voice data.

“Market drivers include legislation requiring broadcasters to make video more accessible and to analyse and derive insight from voice data in contact centres.

“The speech recognition market is set to be worth $21.5billion by 2024 and Speechmatics is ideally positioned to compete for a large slice of this exciting industry.”

The UK Government, Deloitte UK, BBC and what3words are among Speechmatics customers.

And the 2019 Queen’s Awards winner, which has offices in Kirkwood Road, Cambridge, has just announced a deal with the London-based information-driven consultancy SOHO2.

Its new product Speech2 promises to be an “industry first any-context voice solution”, analysing content from calls for compliance, legal and contact centre applications.

It will enable companies to identify risks, pinpoint sales opportunities and analyse customer feelings and behavior through choice of words.

Jeff Palmer, VP of sales at Speechmatics, said: “Speech2 will deliver unparalleled insights and risk management abilities, using Speechmatics’ any-context speech recognition engine. Soho2 also brings depth in services that deliver high-value machine learning solutions, which will benefit our customer-base. We’re excited to be working with Soho2 and seeing how their customers derive value from their voice data and view it with a renewed sense of curiosity.”

Mkhululi brings Ultimate Praise Experience to Bulawayo,Mkhululi brings Ultimate Praise Experience to Bulawayo,"Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent

GOSPEL singer Mkhululi Bhebhe hopes to fill up the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair Hall 3 in December when he holds his debut concert in Bulawayo.

Themed ‘An Ultimate Praise Experience with Mkhululi Bhebhe’, the event will take place on December 15.

Over the years, Bhebhe, an Idols East Africa top 10 finalist, has been an integral part of SA’s leading gospel group Joyous Celebration. He went solo this year and wants to praise and worship with the masses in the city where he was raised.

This concert will also serve as a launch of his DVD that he recorded last year in Johannesburg. Those who will attend will therefore have a live experience of the 21-track offing.

MK, as Bhebhe is affectionately known, said The Ultimate Experience was a show that will reveal a different side of him.

“With this concert, I want to show people another side of Mkhululi that they didn’t know about. I had only shown people the dancing Mkhululi but with this project, I’ll take them on comprehensive praise and worship journey,” said MK.

The Ultimate Praise Experience, MK said was more than a concert.

“It’s more than a concert or a title of an album as it’s a brand and concept that I want to build. I want it to grow from Bulawayo then I’ll take it to other parts of the country, region and even the world.”

Tickets for the show are expected to go on sale today and have been pegged at $3/R50 for the Bronze circle and $5/R80 for the silver circle. Golden circle tickets are limited to 50 people and will cost $10 or R150.

He said he had decided to launch his DVD in his home town to motivate up-and-coming musicians as well as give them a platform to shine.

“I want to pave a way for people who are talented but don’t have the platform. I want to put the spotlight on such people on the day of the concert.

“When I was new in the music industry, it wasn’t easy for me to get a platform to show off my talent and with this concert I want to give them that,” said MK.",https://www.chronicle.co.zw/mkhululi-brings-ultimate-praise-experience-to-bulawayo/,"Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent GOSPEL singer Mkhululi Bhebhe hopes

China’s $900 billion New Silk Road. What you need to know,China’s $900 billion New Silk Road. What you need to know,"You’ve probably heard of the Silk Road, the ancient trade route that once ran between China and the West during the days of the Roman Empire. It’s how oriental silk first made it to Europe. It’s also the reason China is no stranger to carrots.

And now it’s being resurrected. Announced in 2013 by President Xi Jinping, a brand new double trade corridor is set to reopen channels between China and its neighbours in the west: most notably Central Asia, the Middle East and Europe.

According to the Belt and Road Action Plan released in 2015, the initiative will encompass land routes (the “Belt”) and maritime routes (the “Road”) with the goal of improving trade relationships in the region primarily through infrastructure investments.

Image: Lowy Institute

The aim of the $900 billion scheme, as China explained recently, is to kindle a “new era of globalization”, a golden age of commerce that will benefit all. Beijing says it will ultimately lend as much as $8 trillion for infrastructure in 68 countries. That adds up to as much as 65% of the global population and a third of global GDP, according to the global consultancy McKinsey.

But reviews from the rest of the world have been mixed, with several countries expressing suspicion about China’s true geopolitical intentions, even while others attended a summit in Beijing earlier this month to praise the scale and scope of the project.

The project has proved vast, expensive and controversial. Four years after it was first unveiled, the question remains:

Why is China doing it?

One strong incentive is that Trans-Eurasian trade infrastructure could bolster poorer countries to the south of China, as well as boost global trade. Domestic regions are also expected to benefit – especially the less-developed border regions in the west of the country, such as Xinjiang.

The economic benefits, both domestically and abroad, are many, but perhaps the most obvious is that trading with new markets could go a long way towards keeping China’s national economy buoyant.

Among domestic markets set to gain from future trade are Chinese companies – such as those in transport and telecoms – which now look poised to grow into global brands.

Chinese manufacturing also stands to gain. The country’s vast industrial overcapacity – mainly in the creation of steel and heavy equipment – could find lucrative outlets along the New Silk Road, and this could allow Chinese manufacturing to swing towards higher-end industrial goods.

A new global superpower

Some Western diplomats have been wary in their response to the proposed trade corridor, seeing it as a land grab designed to promote China's influence globally, but there’s little evidence to suggest the route will benefit China alone.

The scheme is essentially a “domestic policy with geostrategic consequences, rather than a foreign policy,” Charles Parton, a former EU diplomat in China, told the Financial Times.

There's no doubt that China is growing into a geopolitical heavyweight, stepping into the breach left by the United States on matters of free trade and climate change.

""As some Western countries move backwards by erecting 'walls', China is contriving to build bridges, both literal and metaphorical,"" ran a recent commentary by Xinhua, a Chinese state-run media agency.

Bridges are key to China's strategy, says Kevin Liu, Chairman of Asia, Partners Group.

He explains: ""The superpower status the US has achieved is to a great extent grounded on the security blanket it offered to its allies. Geopolitically, China decided a long time ago that security was too expensive an offer to make. Instead, this new superpower may offer connectivity.""

If combined with enhanced global connectivity, China's enormous gravity could become an even more meaningful engine for the global economy,"" Liu adds.

Which countries stand to gain?

Sixty-two countries could see investments of up to US$500 billion over the next five years, according to Credit Suisse, with most of that channelled to India, Russia, Indonesia, Iran, Egypt, the Philippines and Pakistan.

Chinese companies are already behind several energy projects, including oil and gas pipelines between China and Russia, Kazakhstan and Myanmar. Roads and infrastructure projects are also underway in Ethiopia, Kenya, Laos and Thailand.

Pakistan is one of the New Silk Road’s foremost supporters. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said the trade route marked the “dawn of a truly new era of synergetic intercontinental cooperation”. Unsurprising praise perhaps from a country that stands at one end of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, where it is poised to benefit from $46 billion in new roads, bridges, wind farms and other China-backed infrastructure projects.

Support has come from further afield as well, with Chile’s president, Michelle Bachelet, predicting the route would “pave the way for a more inclusive, equal, just, prosperous and peaceful society with development for all”.

Who’s against it?

Perhaps the route’s most vocal critic so far has been India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Vehemently opposed to the $46 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which runs through a part of Kashmir claimed by India, he has called the route a “colonial enterprise” that threatens to strew “debt and broken communities in its wake”. He even boycotted the recent One Belt One Road summit in Beijing.

Modi wasn’t the only leader notably absent from the gathering. No officials from Japan, South Korea or North Korea made an appearance, and of the Group of Seven (G7) industrialized nations, the only representative to attend was Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni.

“While countries welcome Beijing's generosity, they are simultaneously wary of its largesse. China's growing influence is a concern for nations whose political interests do not always align with Beijing's,"" explains Paul Haenle, director of the Carnegie-Tsinghua Centre for Global Policy.

While China’s growing influence is a concern for nations whose political interests aren’t aligned with Beijing’s, Chinese spokespeople have repeatedly denied charges of a play for global dominance.

The New Silk Road is “not and will never be neocolonialism by stealth”, China announced recently in state media.

Who’ll foot the bill?

The One Belt One Road project already has $1 trillion of projects underway, including major infrastructure works in Africa and Central Asia.

Ahead of the Beijing summit earlier this month, the China Development Bank had set aside almost $900 billion alone for more than 900 projects. China’s Big Four state-owned banks extended an estimated $90 billion in loans to the economies related to the initiative last year alone.

The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which was launched in January 2016, has authorized capital of $100 billion. $20 billion will be paid-in capital from 80 shareholders, of which China is the largest with a 28% share.

Despite this largesse, though, the AIIB has provided less than $2 billion in funding over the past year. The bank’s president, Jin Liquin, told the World Economic Forum summit in China last year: ""We will support the One Belt, One Road project. But before we spend shareholders' money, which is really the taxpayers' money, we have three requirements.""

What were these? The new trade route would have to promote growth, be socially acceptable and abide by environmental laws, Jin said. How well the project fares against these three criteria has yet to be seen.",https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/06/china-new-silk-road-explainer/,"You've probably heard of the Silk Road, the ancient trade route that once

"Canada-China relations to enter ‘golden’ era, Chinese Premier says","Canada-China relations to enter ‘golden’ era, Chinese Premier says","Former Canadian prime minister Jean Chretien, left, and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang shake hands before their meeting at the Zhongnanhai leadership compound on Tuesday in Beijing.kenzaburo fukuhara//Getty Images Share

Canada and China are set to enter a new ""golden"" era under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, China's second-most powerful man told Jean Chrétien in Beijing this week.

""Mr. Chrétien, it will be like the golden years of your relationship with China will be back hopefully,"" Premier Li Keqiang told the former Canadian prime minister in a half-hour meeting Tuesday.

Mr. Chrétien in turn offered the ""best wishes of Prime Minister Trudeau,"" he said in an interview with The Globe and Mail.

Mr. Chrétien, in China on behalf of the Denton's law firm, said Chinese leaders are looking forward to Mr. Trudeau's visit to China for G20 meetings in Hangzhou in September. He would not say if the two men discussed an official Canadian visit in advance of the fall meetings, or whether a Canada-China free trade deal would be on the agenda.

""We discussed all sorts of files and we discussed international files and we discussed Canada-China relations ... so I was in a position to make hopefully some very effective representations,"" he said.

Mr. Chrétien has long-standing ties to China, a country he courted both in and out of office. He championed the ""Team Canada"" trade missions that elevated the profile of Canadian businesses in the 1990s, but has continued to return in later years as an ""old friend"" of China.

The Chinese premier told Mr. Chrétien ""there is great scope"" for further co-operation between the two countries, and ""appreciates"" efforts by Mr. Trudeau to warm relations, Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported. Last year was the first since 1989, the year of the Tiananmen massacre, that Canada sent no cabinet ministers to China.

The Trudeau government, however, wants to press forward on several major new trade initiatives, including talks toward a free-trade agreement. International Trade Minister Chrystia Freeland has suggested Canada will also seek membership in the Asian Infrastructure Development Bank, a major Chinese initiative seen as a counter to U.S. dominance in the global financial system.

Although a free-trade deal would likely take years to complete, Canada could attempt to sign an agreement to ""achieve parity"" with a China-Australia free-trade agreement that entered into force late last year, said Sarah Kutulakos, executive director at the Canada China Business Council.

Mr. Chrétien, she said, has helped provided ""a bridge"" between Canada and China over the years. ""He's still highly respected in China,"" she said, and ""there is a fair amount of continuity under him.""

The Chinese premier's reference to ""golden years"" echoes recent language used between China and Britain, which have heralded a ""golden era"" in ties. London's courting of Beijing has resulted in major new trade contracts, including a deal by a Chinese company to develop nuclear power in Britain, and praise from Beijing.

Last fall, the nationalist Global Times newspaper called Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne ""the first Western official in recent years who has stressed more the region's business potential instead of finding fault over the human-rights issue.""

But the British embrace of the ""golden era"" has been controversial, labelled a ""national humiliation"" by Prime Minister David Cameron's own former strategy adviser. The country's newspaper columnists have called it a ""grand kowtow"" to an authoritarian regime that imprisons critics and censors free speech.

Mr. Chrétien travels regularly to China on behalf of his own private interests, including the Denton's law firm.

A spokeswoman for Global Affairs Canada said she ""had no information"" on the Chrétien visit.

""Although our ambassador accompanied Mr. Chrétien, this is out of courtesy to him as our former prime minister,"" Tania Assaly said in an e-mail.",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/canada-china-relations-to-enter-golden-era-chinese-premier-says/article29688251/,"Chinese Premier meets with Jean Chrétien in Beijing while former Canadian
