"ONGC Videsh, Oil India may join forces again to bid for new offshore blocks 
in Bangladesh | Company Business News","ONGC Videsh, Oil India may join forces again to bid for new offshore blocks 
in Bangladesh","New Delhi: A consortium of state-run ONGC Videsh Ltd and Oil India Ltd is expected to bid for offshore hydrocarbon blocks in Bangladesh, amid India’s efforts to reduce its dependence on a few oil-exporting countries for the fuel.

Bangladesh government-owned PetroBangla in March floated a tender inviting bids for the exploration of 24 offshore blocks, including 15 deep-sea and nine shallow-sea blocks. Bids are to be submitted by 9 September.

“A consortium of OVL and Oil India, which already has operations in Bangladesh, is likely to bid in the tender currently open for offshore blocks in the country,"" said a person aware of the developments.

An executive with one of these two oil companies said the blocks on offer have to be evaluated before a final decision is made. “The bids need to be submitted by September, so there is considerable time for a concrete decision on this.""

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resultant energy market volatility have left Indian oil-producing companies scouting for long-term contracts and stakes in assets across regions to reduce dependence on a few nations.

India imports about 85% of its annual energy requirements. In 2023-24, India imported 232.5 million tonnes of crude.

ONGC Videsh, the overseas arm of state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd, and Oil India are already involved in the exploration of two blocks in Bangladesh.

The two companies did not reply to queries on their plans for bidding in the new blocks on offer.

All boxes ticked

PetroBangla’s tender document seeking bids for the offshore hydrocarbon blocks specifies that the bidders must have daily offshore production of at least 15,000 barrels of oil, or 150 mmscf (million standard cubic feet) of gas, as an operator to quality. In the case of a consortium, at least one of the entities must meet that requirement.

PetroBangla added that the bidders must be involved in the exploration and production of at least one global oil and gas project.

ONGC Videsh qualifies on both terms.

In 2023-24, OVL’s oil production stood at 7.178 million tonnes, as per its annual results. That translates to about 52.61 million barrels, or about 144,150 barrels per day.

Besides, as of 2022-23, ONGC Videsh had investments worth $20.86 billion in 13 oil-and-gas-producing assets across the globe, including in Russia, Vietnam, Venezuela, Colombia, and Abu Dhabi, per its annual report. It had another $487.57 million worth of cumulative investments in 14 exploratory assets across Colombia, Brazil, Libya, Iraq, Vietnam, Bangladesh and Myanmar.

Oil India’s overseas exploration and production portfolio as on 31 March, 2023 was spread across seven countries—four producing assets in Russia and Venezuela, two discovered and development assets in Mozambique and Nigeria, and four exploratory assets in Libya, Gabon, and Bangladesh.

In 2023-24, Oil India produced 3.359 million tonnes of oil, which translates to about 24.62 million barrels, or 67,456 barrels per day. Its production last financial year was 5.76% higher than in 2022-23.

Bangladesh’s depleting reserves

Along with Oil India, ONGC Videsh is involved in the exploration of two blocks in Bangladesh.

Block SS-09 was awarded to a consortium of OVL and Oil India in 2012. The Bangladesh government, PetroBangla, and a consortium of ONGC Videsh, Oil India and Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration and Production Co. Ltd (Bapex) signed a production-sharing contract on 17 February 2014.

ONGC Videsh is the operator of the block with a 45% participatory interest, while Oil India and Bapex hold 45% and 10% participatory interest, respectively.

Similarly, ONGC Videsh is the operator in Bangladesh’s Block SS-04, with a 45% participatory interest.

Bangladesh has oil reserves of about 82 million barrels. The country’s move to offer 24 offshore blocks comes amid expectations that its gas reserves will be depleted by 2033 if no new major discoveries are made.

On 16 July, Bangladesh daily The Daily Star cited data from PetroBangla that of the country’s original reserve of 28 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of natural gas, about 18 Tcf of gas had been consumed, leaving on 10 Tcf of natural gas.

PetroBangla estimates another 1 Tcf of gas in the possible reserve category.",https://www.livemint.com/companies/ongc-videsh-ovl-oil-india-oil-bid-bangladesh-offshore-hydrocarbon-blocks-petrobangla-crude-oil-natural-gas-11721127931128.html,"New Delhi: A consortium of state-run ONGC Videsh Ltd and Oil India Ltd is

ONGC's high investments to delay deleveraging over next 12-24 months: S&P,ONGC's high investments to delay deleveraging over next 12-24 months: S&P,"S&P said its rating on ONGC (BBB-/Stable) remains constrained by the sovereign credit rating on India (BBB-/Stable/A-3).

A step-up in investments at Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) will slow down its deleveraging over the next 12-24 months, eroding headroom for the state-owned firm's 'bbb+' standalone credit profile, S&P Global Ratings said on Monday.

Stating that ONGC's financial results for the fiscal year ended on March 31, 2024, were in line with expectations, S&P said despite a decline of 2-3 per cent in the company's domestic oil and gas production volumes and lower realizations in fiscal 2024, EBITDA grew to Rs 1.1 lakh crore from Rs 93,600 crore in fiscal 2023.

""We attribute the higher EBITDA to the strong performance of downstream subsidiaries - Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL), which together accounted for about 30 per cent of the group's EBITDA during the year. We forecast ONGC's EBITDA will remain at about Rs 1 lakh crore over fiscal years 2025 and 2026,"" it said.

ONGC's integrated operations will support earnings resilience.

The firm's production volumes should rise gradually over fiscal years 2025 (April 2024 to March 2025) and FY2026 as the company scales up oil and gas production from its block in the Krishna Godavari (KG) basin in India.

""We expect output from the group's international assets, held through ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL), to grow by 2-5 per cent during this period,"" S&P said.

The higher output should mitigate the impact of moderating oil prices based on S&P Global Ratings' Brent crude oil price assumption of $85 per barrel for the rest of 2024 and $80 per barrel for 2025 and 2026.



""Our base case also assumes the average realization on the company's domestic gas production will be $9.5 per metric million British thermal unit (mmBtu) for the next two years. This is given the mix of output from nomination fields and difficult acreages, and India's administered gas price formula,"" the rating agency said.

It forecast ONGC's annual capital expenditure will increase to Rs 57,000-58,000 crore annually over the next 12-24 months, from about Rs 52,000 crore in fiscal 2024 (April 2023 to March 2024).

Of this, the company is likely to spend Rs 33,000-35,000 crore annually to primarily arrest declining output from its matured fields in India. The balance will be spent at its downstream subsidiaries, MRPL and HPCL, to enhance refining and petrochemical capacities.

""ONGC's planned capital investments are likely to consume about 60 per cent of the company's operating cash flow. This, and ONGC's stated financial policy on shareholder distributions, will leave limited headroom for the company to undertake sizable additional investments, in our view.

""We expect ONGC's ratio of funds from operations (FFO)-to-debt to remain at 45-55 per cent in fiscals 2025 and 2026, compared with about 55 per cent in fiscal 2024, assuming the acquisition of ONGC Petro additions Ltd (OPaL) will be completed in fiscal 2025. This leaves limited headroom to our downside trigger of 40 per cent FFO-to-debt for the 'bbb+' rating,"" it said.

S&P said its rating on ONGC (BBB-/Stable) remains constrained by the sovereign credit rating on India (BBB-/Stable/A-3).",https://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/ongc-s-high-investments-to-delay-deleveraging-over-next-12-24-months-s-p-124052700778_1.html,"""We expect output from the group's international assets, held through ONGC

"Coal India, NMDC, ONGC Videsh Seek Overseas Critical Mineral Assets","Coal India, NMDC, ONGC Videsh Seek Overseas Critical Mineral Assets","The Indian government has announced plans for public sector companies like Coal India, NMDC, and ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) to actively seek critical mineral assets overseas. This strategic move aims to secure vital mineral resources essential for various industries, including clean energy technologies and electric vehicles.

Introduction of Overseas Ventures

Coal India, NMDC, and ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) are set to explore critical mineral assets abroad under the guidance of a group of secretaries. These public sector undertakings (PSUs) are already established players in the international market and are well-positioned to expand their presence in search of essential mineral resources.

ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) Leads the Charge

ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL), the overseas investment arm of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), will play a significant role in the overseas venture. As a seasoned player in the global energy market, OVL brings valuable expertise and experience to the table, ensuring effective exploration and acquisition of critical mineral assets.

Active Pursuit of Mineral Assets

Coal India has initiated active pursuit of lithium blocks in Chile, signaling its proactive approach towards securing critical minerals. Similarly, NMDC is already engaged in mining operations in Australia, focusing on gold mines and exploring opportunities in lithium mining. These efforts highlight the commitment of Indian PSUs to diversify their mineral portfolios and mitigate supply risks.

Khanij Bidesh India Ltd (KABIL) Joint Venture

Khanij Bidesh India Ltd (KABIL), a joint venture of three PSUs – National Aluminium Company Ltd (Nalco), Hindustan Copper Ltd (HCL), and Mineral Exploration and Consultancy Ltd (MECL), is dedicated to scouting for mineral assets overseas. This collaborative effort strengthens India’s position in the global mineral market and enhances its resource security.

Strategic Partnerships and Trade Agreements

India is actively exploring partnerships with countries like Chile and Australia to secure access to copper, lithium, and other critical mineral assets. Efforts are underway to expand existing Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) to include provisions for critical minerals, facilitating government-to-government access to these resources. Additionally, India is exploring joint exploration ventures with countries like Zambia to tap into critical mineral reserves.

Importance of Critical Minerals

Critical minerals such as copper, lithium, nickel, and cobalt are integral to various clean energy technologies, including wind turbines, electric vehicles, and electricity networks. As the demand for these minerals continues to rise, securing a stable supply becomes paramount for driving sustainable growth and achieving energy transition goals.",https://currentaffairs.adda247.com/coal-india-nmdc-ongc-videsh-seek-overseas-critical-mineral-assets/,"The Indian government has announced plans for public sector companies like

"Indias mineral diplomacy vs Chinas contentious Tibet mining: A comparative 
analysis","Indias mineral diplomacy vs Chinas contentious Tibet mining: A comparative 
analysis","In recent years, India and China have intensified their mining activities abroad, adopting markedly different strategies with significant implications. While India focuses on securing critical minerals through international collaborations, China’s expansion in Tibet has sparked considerable environmental and cultural concerns.

India’s strategic mineral acquisition

The Indian government is proactively seeking mining opportunities overseas, led by a team of Secretary-level officials under the SGOS-3 framework. Key entities in this initiative include Khanij Bidesh India Limited (KABIL), National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC), Coal India, and ONGC Videsh Ltd. Their primary goal is to secure vital minerals essential for India's industrial growth.

Recent efforts have seen Indian delegations, including representatives from Hindustan Aluminium Corporation Limited and Adani Enterprises Limited, visiting countries such as Chile, Argentina, Australia, and Belarus. India is particularly interested in mining lithium and copper in Chile, with negotiations underway for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA). In Argentina, mining operations are set to begin across five lithium blocks. Additionally, Coal India is contemplating lithium mining in Chile, while KABIL is conducting feasibility studies for potential projects in Belarus. Four Indian Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) are expected to commence operations in Belarus shortly.

China’s controversial mining expansion in Tibet

In contrast, China’s mining expansion in Tibet under President Xi Jinping has raised widespread alarm over its environmental and cultural impact. Tibet, rich in mineral resources and ecological diversity, faces extensive mining operations that threaten its delicate environment and cultural heritage.

The Gyama Copper Polymetallic Mine in Tibet, notorious for a disastrous landslide that buried over 80 miners, exemplifies the risks associated with these ventures. The Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) has repeatedly warned about potential disasters linked to such mining activities. The Julong Copper Mine, one of the world’s largest, is set for significant expansion, exacerbating environmental concerns. Reports of worker disappearances underscore the severe human risks involved in these operations.

Critics argue that China’s aggressive mining practices in Tibet are driven by commercial exploitation with little regard for local ecological and cultural significance. They call for sustainable practices and the inclusion of local communities to mitigate the ecological and social impacts of mining in this sensitive region.

Conclusion

India’s overseas mining endeavours aim to secure essential minerals through strategic international partnerships, while China’s approach in Tibet has drawn substantial criticism for its environmental and human costs. India's efforts, emphasising collaboration and sustainable resource acquisition, stand in stark contrast to China’s controversial practices in Tibet. This juxtaposition highlights the differing priorities and methodologies of these two Asian powerhouses in their quest for mineral resources.",https://www.zeebiz.com/economy-infra/world-economy/news-india-s-strategic-mineral-pursuits-vs-china-s-controversial-expansion-in-tibet-290577,"India is particularly focused on mining lithium and copper in Chile, with

"As sanctions return to Venezuela, OVL has a problem on its hands | Company 
Business News","As sanctions return to Venezuela, OVL has a problem on its hands","New Delhi: The return of US sanctions to Venezuela after a six-month breather has thrown India's oil-for-dividends plan with the Latin American country into disarray, sending ONGC Videsh Ltd scrambling for new options to get the promised oil cargoes.

The six-month sanctions waiver ended on Friday with no progress on the oil-for-dividends plan agreed between the two countries. US officials have now indicated that the sanctions will return.

OVL is looking at viable options to secure the crude oil, and its legal and marketing teams have been put into actionforthesame, a person aware of the matter said.

""It would take time for Venezuela to send oil. The production capacity of the country has also declined over the years of sanction which need to be rejuvenated. The likelihood of another sanction raises concern whether these cargoes would actually get delivered,"" the person said on condition of anonymity.

Venezuela's state-run energy monopoly PdVSA owes about $600 million in dividends to OVL, which owns 49% stake in the operational San Cristobal project, and 11% in Carabobo, which is under development.

In January, Mint had reported that OVL is in talks with its Venezuelan partner PdVSA to secure oil cargoes for settling the long pending dues to the ONGC arm.

In response to a query, an OVL spokesperson said: ""Our legal and marketing teams are working on the issue,"" adding the company would revert after a clear picture emerges.

Queries sent to the Union ministry of petroleum and natural gas and Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PdVSA) remained unanswered till press time.

The US, which had briefly lifted sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector in October, is planning to revive them over Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro's failure to hold free and fair elections.

The return of sanctions may also impact OVL's plans to get operatorship of the two Venezuelan projects. OVL managing director Rajarshi Gupta had said in February that the company would look at investing more in the country to increase productivity.

“The lifting of the sanctions is a very positive sign. We are in very advanced discussions with the government of Venezuela to get further cargoes to liquidate our dividends and at the same time to get the operatorship of the two projects that we have there and increase the production from there. The two projects we will have to invest to get more production. That’s still being worked out. We will have to invest, because Venezuela has the largest reserves in the world. So, if we invest more, we will get more production,"" he had said.

Currently, OVL and PdVSA jointly operate the projects. OVL acquired 40% in San Cristobal project in Venezuela in 2008, with PdVSA owning the balance 60%. ONGC Videsh holds the stake through ONGC Nile Ganga (San Cristobal) BV, a wholly owned subsidiary of ONGC Nile Ganga B.V.",https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/as-sanctions-return-to-venezuela-ovl-has-a-problem-on-its-hands-11713520236083.html,"India's oil-for-dividends deal with Venezuela faces uncertainty due to

ONGC dividend stuck as sanctions re-imposed on Venezuelan crude oil,ONGC dividend stuck as sanctions re-imposed on Venezuelan crude oil,"NEW DELHI: The re-imposition of sanctions on Venezuelan crude oil by the US has disrupted ONGC Videsh Limited (OVL), the overseas arm of India’s state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), plan to retrieve its dividend worth $600 million stuck in Venezuela.

The company is planning to deploy its legal and marketing teams to address the issue. OVL earlier announced importing oil from Venezuela in lieu of stuck dividends worth $600 million. But the company had not received any oil after the lifting of sanctions, said an official. “Our legal and commercial teams are studying the proposal. Will revert back once clarity emerges,” ONGC Videsh sources said.

This development comes amid the US re-imposing sanctions on Venezuelan crude oil. The US had previously eased these sanctions in October 2023, allowing Venezuela to resume crude exports. However, citing concerns about a lack of progress on democratic principles ahead of Venezuela’s July elections, the Biden administration opted not to renew a key license that expired on April 17, effectively re-imposing sanctions.

According to the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), a General License (GL) has been replaced, prohibiting US companies from initiating new business ventures in Venezuela’s oil sector. However, a grace period exists until May 31, 2024, allowing them to complete existing deals.

India last imported Venezuelan crude in 2020 when the US imposed secondary sanctions on the nation. Until 2019, India was Venezuela’s third-largest purchaser, after the US and China, importing roughly 300,000 b/d on average.

Post-lifting the sanction, India emerged as the top buyer of Venezuelan crude for two consecutive months of December 2023 and January 2024. As per the energy intelligence firm Kpler, India imported more than 2,54,000 barrels per day (b/d) in January 2024 and over 1,91,000 b/d in December 2023 from Venezuela. According to reports, after easing the sanctions, Reliance Industries (RIL) is back in the market for Venezuelan oil that is likely available at a discounted price.

Officials of OVL maintain not getting oil from Venezuela post-lifting the sanctions. “ONGC Videsh has not received any oil after lifting the sanctions,” said the official.

As per OPEC’s monthly oil market report for April 2024, Venezuela produced crude 804 thousand barrels per day (tb/d) in January 2024, 822 (tb/d) in February 2024, and 809 tb/d in March 2024. In February 2024, Rajarshi Gupta, managing director of OVL, said he is in talks with the Venezuelan government to gain proprietorship of two of its projects in Venezuela.",https://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2024/Apr/20/ongc-dividend-stuck-as-sanctions-re-imposed-on-venezuelan-crude-oil,"OVL earlier announced importing oil from Venezuela in lieu of stuck

Indian ONGC slow on exploring reserves,Indian ONGC slow on exploring reserves,"A lone international contractor hired to delineate hydrocarbons in Bangladesh's offshore blocks did little over the past two years, while the country suffers fuel shortages, sources say.

India's oil-and-gas-exploration company named ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) is currently the only international oil company (IOC) that has rights to explore untapped offshore in some blocks in the Bay of Bengal, says a senior Petrobangla official.

""But, after a 'failed' attempt at Kanchan gas-well under the SS-04 block in Moheshkhali Island a couple of years back, the Indian company did not move forward with its exploration works,"" he adds.

The tenure of its production-sharing contract (PSC) with Petrobangla is set to expire in February 2025.

Under the PSC, the oil-and-gas-exploration company has contractual obligations to drill two more wells -Titly in block SS-04 and Moitree in block SS-09.

But the OVL management has yet to engage any contractor for the drilling of Titly and Moitree wells, they said.

With only one year left from its PSC tenure, the Indian firm is not likely be able to complete drilling in the given time, said sources.

The firm has a budget of US$65 million to drill the wells, they said.

Previously, Petrobangla had extended OVL's PSC tenure until February 2025 from February 2023 at the latter's request, as it 'failed' to carry out the necessary exploration works within its previous stipulated timeframe.

It was the third extra period of time that the OVL got from the Bangladesh Oil, Gas and Mineral Corporation or Petrobangla.

The state corporation earlier had extended the company's PSC tenure by two more years until February 2023 from February 2021 in its bid to boost offshore exploration.

Meanwhile, Petrobangla signed two PSCs with OVL, the operator of shallow sea (SS) offshore blocks SS-04 and SS-09, on February 17, 2014 which was set to expire in February 2019 as per terms of the original PSC.

At Kanchan gas well, OVL had drilled beyond its targeted depth of around 4,228 metres in search of a commercially viable gas deposit. But all its efforts ended up finding only huge deposits of clay and shell-stone sequence and no sandstone, meaning there is no gas-reserve prospect there.

The Kanchan well was up for the first offshore drilling in the country's maritime territory in last six years.

Australian company Santos along with Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration and Production Company Ltd (BAPEX) in February 2017 drilled Magnama-02 well under block 16 only to find it dry.

The joint venture drilled the offshore well into a depth of around 3,200 metres, which cost BAPEX an estimated $29 million.

The country has no producing offshore gas well, and its entire natural gas output comes from onshore fields as well as import of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

OVL is the operator of blocks SS-04 and SS-09, having a participating stake of 45 per cent. Block SS-04 covers an area of 7,269 square kilometres (sq-km), while block SS-09 stretches over an area of 7,026 sq-km. Water depth of both the blocks ranges between 20 metres and 200 metres.

As per the PSC, the firm is committed to conducting 2,700 line-kilometre 2D seismic-data acquisition and processing as well as drilling one exploratory well in block SS-04.

Also, it has to do the same for another 2,700 line-km 2D seismic- data acquisition and processing as well as drill two exploratory wells in block SS-09.

The OVL owners will be allowed to operate and sell oil and gas for 20 years from an oil-field and 25 years from a gas-field under the deals. The company has already completed around 3,100 line-km 2D seismic survey for both the blocks.

Sakhalin-I fund: OVL looks to transfer $600 million in roubles,Sakhalin-I fund: OVL looks to transfer $600 million in roubles,"ONGC Videsh's stake was restored in Dec 2022 conditionally

NEW DELHI: ONGC Videsh ( OVL ) is moving to transfer about $600 million in roubles to Russia as its contribution in 'abandonment fund' for securing abandoned wells in the Sakhalin-I oil project, meeting a condition for registering its 20% stake with the new operator appointed by Moscow after ExxonMobil's exit in 2022.

""We expect to make the transfer in a month or two. Rouble payment is the most viable option due to Western sanctions and banking restrictions on Russia as well as Moscow's counter-sanctions. We can buy rouble and also use dividend of more than 16 billion roubles from Vankorneft project stuck in Russia,"" a person aware of the discussions said.

OVL received its share of the abandonment fund, last estimated at $2 billion, from foreign-party administrator JP Morgan on April 6, 2023 but could not transfer it to Russia due to banking challenges. Transferring the fund was a key condition for formalising ONGC Videsh's stake in the project under the new entity formed after ExxonMobil's exit.

Moscow had seized the Sakhalin-I project in Oct 2022 after ExxonMobil's exit due to Western sanctions, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in Feb that year. The rights of investors in the venture were transferred to Rosneft subsidiary Sakhalinmaorneftegaz-shelf and companies were asked to apply for equity afresh. ONGC Videsh's stake was restored in Dec 2022 conditionally. The abandonment fund is built with revenue contribution in proportion to equity held by each member of the consortium.

"India hurries ops at terror-hit gasfield amid volatile prices worries | 
Today News",India hurries ops at terror-hit gasfield amid volatile prices worries,"New Delhi: The operating committee of the Mozambican gasfield where an ONGC Videsh-led Indian consortium has a 30% stake is set to meet by the end of this month to review progress in resuming operations at the $20 billion project.

Two people in the know said the meeting would look at speeding up the process of resumption.

Total E&P Mozambique Area 1 Limitada, a subsidiary of TotalEnergies, holds 26.5% in the plant and is its operator.

Operations at the ‘Offshore Area 1’ project in the coastal town of Palma were suspended in April 2021, following attacks by Islamic State terrorists.

“Efforts have been underway to resume the project at the earliest. The security situation is being reviewed. Construction of the project is likely to resume in first half of 2024,” said one of the two people mentioned above.

Three Indian state-run companies hold a total of 30% in the project. ONGC Videsh holds 16%, BPRL Ventures Mozambique BV, a subsidiary of BPCL, 10% and Oil India Ltd 4%. Queries mailed to TotalEnergies, OVL, BPCL and Oil India remained unanswered till press time.

Efforts to resume operations follow volatility in the global energy market due to the Ukraine war.

Petroleum and natural gas minister Hardeep Singh Puri visited Mozambique in October to discuss the project with the host nation’s minister of mineral resources and energy Carlos Zacarias.

India seeks to increase the share of gas in its total energy mix to 15% by 2030 from the current 6%.

Supplies from Mozambique reach India three to seven days by sea, making it a far better than several other suppliers.

LNG supplies from the US, the second largest supplier of LNG to India take about 25-50 days to reach India.

The website of the project, mzlng.totalenergies.co.mz, shows that the development phase of the project, before production of gas, can begin once a well is drilled and commercial quantities of natural gas have been confirmed through appraisal activities.

“Development generally includes preparing wells for production. Because the natural gas found in Mozambique’s Offshore Area 1 is approximately 40 kilometers offshore and in water depths of approximately 1,600 meters, specially engineered equipment is required to produce, gather, process and transport the natural gas to the onshore facilities for processing,” says the website.

Earlier in February 2023, the chairman and CEO of TotalEnergies, Patrick Pouyanne, visited Cabo Delgado to review the security and humanitarian situation and he entrusted Jean-Christophe Rufin, an expert in humanitarian action and human rights, to assess the humanitarian situation in Cabo Delgado.

India has been trying to widen its source base for its energy needs. The country currently depends on imports for as much as 85% of its oil needs and 55% of its natural gas demand.

So far in FY24 (April-December) India has imported 22,856 million metric standard cubic meter (mmscm), against 20,011 mmsc in the year ago period. Qatar is the largest supplier of gas followed by the UAE and the US.",https://www.livemint.com/news/india/india-hurries-ops-at-terror-hit-gasfield-amid-volatile-prices-worries-11707994052989.html,"The operating committee of the Mozambican gasfield, where an ONGC

The company is also seeking to get the operatorship of its two ongoing projects in Venezuela and invest more in order to increase production, he added.

“Currently, we have a joint operatorship (with PdVSA). Going ahead, we will have more say,” Gupta said. With the US sanctions on Venezuela easing, these negotiations come as part of the company’s strategy to boost its overseas production and gain control of Venezuelan assets.

“We have taken crude in lieu of dividend some time back and this lifting of sanctions is a very positive sign,” Gupta told reporters on the sidelines of the India Energy Week. “We are in advanced discussions with the government of Venezuela to get further cargoes to liquidate our dividends and at the same time to get operatorship of the two projects that we have there and increase our production.”

Venezuela has the largest proven oil reserves in the world and OVL aims to increase its investments in its overseas projects that will aid to its overall output. However, the company is still charting out the size of investment required for the same.

“The investment will not be much in dollar terms, but we will have to invest. Venezuela has the largest reserves in the world. If we invest more, we will get more production,” Gupta said.The company has also taken crude in lieu of dividends earlier. In January, petroleum secretary Pankaj Jain had said that Venezuela has agreed to give crude oil to OVL to help it recoup its pending $600-million dividend.

OVL holds a 40% stake in the San Cristobal field in eastern Venezuela with Venezuelan company PdVSA holding the remainder. The other project includes the Carabobo exploratory project.Speaking about the company’s recent incorporation of a wholly owned subsidiary in Gujarat’s GIFT city and whether it would hold Russian assets in the treasury, Gupta said that the company will look for possible ways to do so going ahead.

“Russian assets are held through our different subsidiaries, any change of shareholding requires regulatory nod. But yes, GIFT city is our focus subsidiary, going forward we will have it (Russian assets) there. Also, existing shareholding if we can transfer, if possible and if there are no taxation leakages, we will look into it,” Gupta said. OVL’s subsidiary, Overseas IFSC, in Gujarat’s GIFT City will function as a treasury hub catering to OVL and its 25 subsidiaries across 15 countries.

Highlighting the company’s investment plans going ahead, the CMD said OVL will be spending Rs 8,000 crore in its exploration and production projects, and with ONGC’s annual investment of Rs 35,000 crore, the combined investment is set to exceed Rs 40,000 crore.

Gupta further said that the company is optimistic of its production growth and projected the company’s output reaching 15-16 million tonne in four years, with improved contributions from Mozambique and Brazil.

Moreover, the company is looking forward to starting the construction of its LNG trains in Mozambique by March 2024 owing to improved supply situation and discussions to lift the force majeure to commence construction.",https://www.financialexpress.com/business/industry-ongc-videsh-looking-to-gain-operatorship-of-two-projects-in-venezuela-3388642/,"ONGC Videsh (OVL), the overseas arm Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC),

OVL currently owns 40% stake in the San Cristobal project, a producing asset, and 11% in Carabobo, which is under development.

The MD said the company would invest further in the existing projects in Venezuela in a bid to increase production. He also said the company is awaiting cargoes from Venezuela in lieu of stuck dividends.

Mint earlier reported that OVL is in talks with its Venezuelan partner PdVSA to secure oil cargoes in lieu of unpaid dividends totalling $600 million.

“The lifting of the sanctions is a very positive sign. We are in very advanced discussions with the government of Venezuela to get further cargoes to liquidate our dividends and at the same time to get the operatorship of the two projects that we have there and increase the production from there. The two projects we will have to invest to get more production. That’s still being worked out,"" Gupta said. “We will have to invest, because Venezuela has the largest reserves in the world. So, if we invest more, we will get more production.""

Currently OVL and PdVSA jointly operate the projects and going forward the company expects to have “more say"" in the projects.

The overseas arm of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC)—OVL—acquired 40% in San Cristobal Project in Venezuela in 2008, with PdVSA owning the balance 60%. ONGC Videsh holds 40% through ONGC Nile Ganga (San Cristobal) BV, a wholly owned subsidiary of ONGC Nile Ganga B.V.

The Carabobo project is part of a consortium which also includes Indian Oil Corporation, Oil India, Repsol YPF (Repsol) and Petroliam Nasional Berhad (PETRONAS).

The consortium has about 40% ownership interest in an ‘Empresa Mixta’ (mixed public, private) company for developing the Carabobo-1 project, where OVL holds 11% stake through its subsidiary Carabobo One AB, registered in Sweden. The remaining stake is owned by Corporacion Venezolana del Petroleo (CVP), a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PdVSA), Venezuela’s state oil company.

Mumbai: ONGC Videsh , the overseas exploration arm of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), has raised $420 million from Singapore 's DBS Bank and state-owned Bank of Baroda (BoB) in a deal closed earlier this month, taking advantage of the recent drop in global interest rates Both the banks are meeting prospective lenders in a bid to distribute the loan to a wider network of banks across Asia, people familiar with the transaction said.""This is a five-year loan raised at about 125 basis points above the corresponding benchmark secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) and is likely to be syndicated to other lenders in the region by next month,"" one of them said.The five-year SOFR is currently at 3.66%, which means ONGC Videsh is paying around 4.91% interest for the loan.

Talking about the interest of PSUs in GIFT city, Rajaraman said a global corporate treasury centre of ONGC Videsh Ltd was inaugurated on Wednesday. “This treasury centre will manage the treasury operations of over 25 subsidiaries of ONGC Videsh Ltd and they are expected to raise close to $4 billion for their international projects, he said while speaking at a seminar on GIFT city on Thursday.” ONGC Videsh Ltd has incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary called OVL Overseas IFSC Ltd at GIFT city.

“The Indian Oil Corporation has commenced operations of the Global Corporate Treasury Centre at GIFT IFSC. They too will manage treasury operations of IOCL’s overseas assets and are expected to raise over $5 billion from the GIFT IFSC,” he added.

Rajaraman said a conference of all central and State public sector units and national cooperatives will be held at IFSC on February 23 to showcase success stories and explore new ways of enabling PSUs to use GIFT city as a platform to consolidate or launch global businesses, extract cost-efficiencies in financing and access structured funds.

New initiatives

Talking about new initiatives, K Rajaraman, said, “We are working on a single window IT system that will enable all regulatory clearances to be provided online. This system is expected to go live from March 2024.”

“The committee on Ease of Doing Business, including digital onboarding of customers, is currently at work, headed by our executive director. We expect this committee to make recommendations which will further improve Ease of Doing Business in IFSC,” he added.

New Delhi: Venezuela has agreed to give oil to ONGC Videsh to help the Indian public sector company recover its $600 million dues as dividend for the stake that it holds in an oilfield in the Latin American country, Petroleum Secretary Pankaj Jain said on Wednesday.

ONGC Videsh (OVL), the overseas investment arm of ONGC, holds a 40 per cent stake in the San Cristobal field in eastern Venezuela's Orinoco Heavy Oil belt, in which Venezuela's State oil company PdVSA holds the majority share.

Jain told reporters that OVL is waiting for the final dates to lift the cargo.

Mint on Wednesday reported that OVL is in talks with its Venezuelan partner to secure oil cargoes in lieu of unpaid dividends totalling $600 million.

“They have agreed to give us some oil in lieu of OVL’s dues. We are waiting for dates (for lifting the crude) from them,"" the secretary said.

OVL acquired 40% in San Cristobal in 2008, with PdVSA owning the balance. OVL holds the stake through ONGC Nile Ganga (San Cristobal) BV, a wholly owned subsidiary of ONGC Nile Ganga BV.

Meanwhile, union petroleum minister Hardeep Singh told the media that there are no talks underway with oil marketing companies for a revision in petrol and diesel prices.

Noting that India is the only country where fuel prices have come down amid the Russia-Ukraine crisis, he said the government’s focus is on ensuring availability and affordability of energy amid geopolitical tensions in West Asia and Ukraine.

India has resumed its purchase of Venezuelan crude oil after the easing of U.S. sanctions on the latter last year.

Earlier, the country’s Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri had said that some Indian money is locked up in Venezuela while referring to OVL’s unpaid dividends and has hinted that India will welcome crude imports from the South American country.

“India consumes more than 5 million barrels of crude oil every day and the demand is only going up. So if Venezuelan oil comes into the market, we welcome it. So do all the others,” Puri had said.

The two companies had signed agreemens to facilitate redevelopment of the San Cristobal joint venture project in Venezuela in 2016.

The agreement had provided a mechanism to liquidate OVL’s outstanding dividends from the project. The company also needed to obtain long-term financing for investment for implementation of the project which aimed at increasing the production from the fields.

OVL was exploring options including allocation of oil by PdVSA to repatriate the dividend, Reuters had reported earlier in the day.

“Post easing of US sanction, OVL is in continuous dialogue with PdVSA for recovery of accrued dividend by various mechanisms including allocation of crude cargoes in lieu of accrued dividend,” Reuters had reported quoting OVL.

No cash? No problem. OVL eyes oil from Venezuela instead | Mint,No cash? No problem. OVL eyes oil from Venezuela instead,"ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) is in talks with its Venezuelan partner to secure oil cargoes in lieu of unpaid dividends totalling $600 million, two people aware of the development said. This follows the US easing sanctions on Venezuela, where India’s overseas explorer has partnered state-owned Petróleos de Venezuela SA (PdVSA) for the San Cristobal project.

Any oil flowing in from Venezuela holds significance for India, the world’s third largest oil buyer that once counted the Latin American country among its largest oil suppliers.

A spokesperson for OVL confirmed in response to a query that the San Cristobal project owes dividends of around $600 million to the company. “Post easing of US sanctions, OVL is in continuous dialogue with PdVSA for recovery of accrued dividend by various mechanisms including allocation of crude cargoes in lieu of accrued dividend,"" the spokesperson said.

OVL, the overseas arm of Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) , acquired 40% in San Cristobal in 2008, with PdVSA owning the balance. OVL holds 40% through ONGC Nile Ganga (San Cristobal) BV, a wholly owned subsidiary of ONGC Nile Ganga BV

While declared dividends add up to $400 million, undeclared dividends account for another $200 million. The dividends have remained unpaid since Venezuela’s late president Hugo Chávez appropriated PdVSA’s earnings for populist spending.

In October 2022, the US announced a political agreement with Venezuela, now led by Nicolás Maduro. Following this, the US treasury department temporarily authorized “all transactions prohibited by the Venezuela Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 591 (the VSR), related to oil and gas sector operations in Venezuela, including transactions with PdVSA, subject to certain conditions.""

The authorization suspended sanctions covering most oil and gas sector operations in Venezuela, including energy sales to the US and others, as well as the payment of taxes, royalties, costs, fees, dividends and profits related to oil and gas sector operations or transactions involving PdVSA.

Queries emailed to the spokespersons of India’s ministries of petroleum & natural gas and external affairs on Thursday remained unanswered. While a PdVSA spokesperson couldn’t be contacted, queries emailed to the Venezuelan embassy in New Delhi on Tuesday were unanswered till press time.

“We are trying to secure oil cargoes in lieu of these stuck dividends. Venezuelan oil is back only for six months with a lot of caveats. Also, they don’t have the capacity to rapidly ramp up production,"" one of the two people cited above said on condition of anonymity.

Analysts concur with this assessment. S&P Global Commodity Insights in a note post the easing of US sanctions said “it expects little change in Venezuelan oil production capacity in the next six months, as PdVSA has little to no investment capital and much of the oil-related infrastructure is in a poor state of repair.""

“Venezuela’s current capacity lies between 800,000-850,000 b/d (barrels per day), with current production sitting around 750,000 b/d,"" the S&P report said and added, “India used to be a regular buyer of Venezuelan crude oil grades prior to the imposition of US sanctions. During the pre-sanctions period from 2017 to 2019, India imported approximately 300,000 b/d of Venezuelan crude grades, with private refiners like Reliance Industries being the key buyers.""

OVL also owns 11% in Venezuela’s Carabobo Project 1, where Indian Oil Corp. Ltd and Oil India Ltd own 3.5% each, with PdVSA and Spanish energy major Repsol holding 71% and 11%, respectively.

OVL has been investing in overseas oil and gas assets as part of India’s energy security strategy. The overall investment by state-owned companies in oil and gas assets abroad stands at $36.555 billion across 55 assets in 25 countries.

India has been facing the issue of stuck dividends in sanctions-hit Russia as well. Mint earlier reported about Indian state-run energy firms including OVL, Bharat PetroResources Ltd, Indian Oil and Oil India facing around $400 million in stuck dividend payments from CSJC Vankorneft and LLC Taas-Yuryakh in Russia given the difficulty in transferring dividend payments due to sanctions on Moscow.

The primary business of ONGC Videsh is to prospect for oil and gas acreages outside India, including exploration, development and production of oil and gas.

ONGC Videsh Limited

It is a wholly-owned subsidiary and overseas arm of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC), the flagship national oil company of India.

ONGC Videsh is the second largest petroleum company of India, next only to its parent ONGC.

ONGC Videsh has stake in 33 oil and gas projects in 15 Countries , viz. Azerbaijan (2 projects), Bangladesh (2 Projects), Brazil (2 projects), Colombia (5 projects), Iran (1 project), Iraq (1 project), Libya (1 project), Mozambique (1 Project), Myanmar (6 projects), Russia (3 projects), South Sudan (2 projects), Syria (2 projects), UAE (1 project), Venezuela (2 projects), and Vietnam (2 projects).

India's ONGC Videsh to resume gas exploration in Bay of Bengal,India's ONGC Videsh to resume gas exploration in Bay of Bengal,"India's oil and gas exploration firm ONGC Videsh Ltd will continue the exploration job in shallow water in the Bay of Bengal, as the 'logging tools' that got stuck during offshore drilling at Kanchan have been cleared.

Its drilling contractor - Chinese Sinopec - will reinitiate Bangladesh's maiden offshore drilling at Kanchan to delineate a new hydrocarbon reserve in the Bay, said sources.

The incident involving the logging tools, however, delayed further the much awaited drilling as the Chinese firm crossed the 90-day timeline set between the ONGC and Sinopec to complete the offshore drilling.

The absence of sandstone from the targeted area beneath the sea and huge deposits of clay and shell stone there had made the drilling job ""cumbersome"", said a senior official of Petrobangla.

The drilling right on Kanchan, located under shallow water Block SS-04, is bestowed on ONGC under a production-sharing contract (PSC) with state-run Petrobangla and the government.

The ONGC engaged Sinopec as a contractor to drill the well within 90 days of initiating the work, meaning by December 29, 2021.

Sources said the ONGC initially had planned to carry out Kanchan drilling by December 2020.

The onslaught of the Coronavirus pandemic, subsequent lockdown, restricted movement of personnel and equipment, and tax-payment row with the authorities concerned had earlier prolonged the mandatory drilling of the well by the ONGC.

The ONGC and its drilling subcontractors are already in payment rows due to the delays, said the sources.

Before the coronavirus onslaught, a dispute over advance income tax (AIT) and demurrage payment on drilling equipment were delaying the drilling of the exploratory well.

After resolving the dispute, the Coronavirus issue emerged as a major obstacle to initiating drilling, said the Petrobangla official.

Apart from Kanchan, ONGC will have to drill two more wells - Titly in Block SS-04 and Moitree in Block SS-09 areas - within its contract period up to February 2023.

The drilling of the Kanchan well is the first offshore drilling in the country's maritime territory in five years.

Australian oil-and-gas-exploration-company Santos along with state-run Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration and Production Company Ltd (BAPEX) earlier in February 2017 drilled offshore Magnama-2 well under Block 16 which was found dry after drilling.

The joint venture had drilled the Magnama-2 well to a depth of around 3,200 metres to find it dry.

This drilling cost BAPEX around US$29 million.

There are also no producing offshore gas wells in the country and the entire natural gas output comes from the country's onshore gas fields as well as import of liquefied natural gas or LNG.

The state-run Petrobangla earlier extended the tenure of contract with ONGC by two more years until February 2023 to boost offshore exploration. The deal with the Indian firm was set to expire in February 2021 after an initial two-year extension.

Petrobangla signed two PSCs with ONGC, the operator of blocks SS-04 and SS-09, on February 17 in 2014, which was set to expire in February 2019.

ONGC is the operator of blocks SS-04 and SS-09, having a participating interest of 45 per cent. OIL holds 45 per cent participating interests and the BAPEX holds the remaining 10 per cent.

The Block SS-04 covers an area of 7,269 sqkm while the Block SS-09 stretches over an area of 7,026 sqkm. Water depth of both the blocks ranges between 20 and 200 metres.

As per the PSC, ONGC is committed to conducting 2,700 line-kilometre 2D seismic data-acquisition and -processing and one exploratory well in Block SS-04 and 2,700 line-kilometre 2D seismic data-acquisition and-processing and two exploratory wells in Block SS-09.

The firm will be allowed to operate and sell oil and gas for 20 years from an oil field and 25 years from a gas field.

The ONGC has already completed around 3,100 line-kilometre 2D seismic surveys for both the blocks.

OVL, a wholly-owned subsidiary and the overseas arm of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited ( ONGC ), also plans to mop up another Rs 5,000 crore through commercial paper, a money market instrument, to meet its short-term financing needs. Click here to connect with us on WhatsApp

ONGC has guaranteed all of OVL’s outstanding debt of Rs 38,200 crore for FY23.

The operational linkages are driven by companies operating in the same segment, with OVL being essential to ONGC for providing ownership in international oil and gas-producing assets.

It had a stake in 32 oil and gas projects across 15 countries, including Azerbaijan, Bangladesh and Brazil as of April 1, 2023.

Rating agency India Ratings has assigned “AAA” to the proposed NCDs and an “A1+” rating for commercial paper.

Given the company’s overseas operations, OVL’s entire loan book is foreign currency (FC)-denominated.

However, it is presented in rupee terms for the consideration of the balance sheet and communication.

The total debt consisted of foreign currency bonds worth Rs 11,170 crore and term loans to the tune of Rs 27,020 crore at the end of September 2023.

A bulk of the debt addition in OVL takes place at the time of a major acquisition, while the ongoing capex and operations are managed by internal accruals and debt refinancing, the rating agency said.

OVL typically takes these bonds/loans for five-to-10 years having bullet maturities.

It has repayments of around Rs 19,600 crore in FY25.

Of the repayments of dues, Rs 4,400 crore is in FY24.

The company has already refinanced loans of Rs 4,140 crore in May 2023 and repaid the balance from internal accruals.

OVL may hold Russia assets via new arm in GIFT City,OVL may hold Russia assets via new arm in GIFT City,"State-run ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) may incorporate a subsidiary in the GIFT International Financial Services Centre in Gujarat soon to hold its Russian oil assets.

The move follows the inability of OVL’s Singapore holding arm to receive dividends from the oil assets due to the sanctions on Russia. Including Russia, OVL owns Participating Interests in 32 oil and gas assets in 15 countries.

OVL did not respond to email queries sent to the company.

The outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war last year created a fresh round of headwinds for OVL, which a section of the government feels has not been able to reap the benefits of its substantial holdings in oil assets overseas.

With Russia nationalising oil output from the Sakhalin-I oil field after the Ukraine war, OVL is just a dividend-receiving shareholder compared to the earlier practice of getting a share in oil output equivalent to its shareholding (equity oil), an official said. Even then, it would receive fresh dividends only after meeting some conditions.

Around $100 million in dividends from the previous year are held up in Russia as Singapore did not permit the remittance of the money to OVL’s Singapore firm, which holds the Russian assets.

OVL set up the Singapore arm due to tax arbitrage as taxes are high in India (15-30% plus cess and surcharge depending on equity holding in overseas company). In Singapore, the tax on dividend income could be zero.

Meanwhile, Reuters reported on Thursday that ONGC hopes to recover over $500 million in dividends pending since 2014 for its stake in Venezuelan projects held through OVL as sanctions on the nation were eased. The Biden administration on Wednesday eased sanctions on Venezuela’s oil sector after the government and opposition parties reached a deal for the 2024 election, in the most extensive rollback of Trump-era restrictions on Caracas.

With GIFT IFSC, India’s answer to global financial centres such as Singapore, officials said OVL is looking at setting up a company in the IFSC to manage overseas assets, especially Russian assets. GIFT IFC, which is treated as a foreign jurisdiction for taxation purposes, offers a host of direct and indirect tax incentives to companies set up there, an official said.

Sakhalin-I, OVL acquired 20% stake in the project in July 2001. Other partners were operator Exxon Nefteggas Limited (ENL) with 30% stake, SODECO, a consortium of Japanese companies 30% and Subsidiaries of Rosneft, the Russian National Oil Company 20%. Sakhalin-1 started 2022-23 by producing about 2,10,000 BOPD in accordance with the planned production profile. However, following the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Operator ENL started significant production curtailment and declared Force Majeure on April 21, 2022. Production became close to zero in September 2022. Russia issued a Presidential Decree on October 07, 2022 transferring all rights & obligations of Sakhalin-1 Consortium to a newly formed entity; Sakhalin-1 Limited Liability Company (Sakhalin-LLC).",https://www.financialexpress.com/business/industry-ovl-may-hold-russia-assets-via-new-arm-in-gift-city-3287691/,"Firm's $100 mn dividends stuck as Singapore unit can't receive the rewards

India's top oil firm ONGC is hoping to recover about USD 413 million of unpaid dividend from an oilfield in Venezuela after sanctions on the Latin American nation were eased, a top source said on Thursday. The US Treasury Department partially lifted sanctions on Venezuela's oil and gas sector last week. The partially lifted sanctions are through a new six-month license authorising transactions in the country's oil and gas sector. The license is to be renewed only if Venezuela can meet commitments leading to fair voting in the next year's presidential election.The US government also amended two other licenses to remove the secondary trading ban on certain Venezuelan sovereign bonds and PDVSA debt and equity. However, a ban on trading in the primary Venezuelan bond market remains in place.ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas investment arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), holds a 40 per cent stake in the San Cristobal oilfield in eastern Venezuela's Orinoco Heavy Oil belt.The project is operated jointly by OVL and Petroleos de Venezuela S .A.

OVL is the overseas investment arm of India’s state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation. According to OVL managing director Rajarshi Gupta, a presence in oil and gas assets in Sri Lanka would gain from the synergies of the larger ONGC group, as the parent company has significant upstream assets and infrastructure in southern India.

Geologically, the island nation and its offshore areas are quite similar to parts of southern India, and the ONGC is experienced in operating in such zones. Sri Lanka’s geographical proximity to India is also seen as a major attraction for OVL.

Gupta added that OVL would be open to government-government negotiations, competitive bidding or any other route that the Sri Lankan government decides on to enable participation in the island country’s upstream petroleum sector.

Asked by when he expects Sri Lanka to open up oil and gas exploration to foreign participation, Gupta said that it would be contingent on the Sri Lankan government finalising its policy for the sector.

"With Sakhalin-I back in steam, ONGC Videsh expects 10-15 % production rise","With Sakhalin-I back in steam, ONGC Videsh expects 10-15 % production rise","By Special Correspondent: ONGC Videsh, the overseas arm of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, expects to cross 12 million metric tonne mark in production of oil and oil equivalent gas during the current financial year against the production of 10.17 MMtoe in the year ended March 31, 2023. The increase in production is expected because of the normalization of output in the Russia’s Sakhalin-I project in which OVL has a 20 per cent stake.

According to a senior official, the company is very much optimistic about the production rise during the current financial year in spite of the ongoing geo-political crisis in Russia and Africa.

“ The production in Sakhalin, which had nosedived to close to zero in September 2022 because of the Russia-Ukraine arm conflict and the subsequent change in the project’s ownership, has been restored completely. Currently the output has been within the planned estimates of 2,10,000 barrels per day,” he said.

He has further added that the production from the project would rise to 1.8 to 2 MMtoe during the current financial year against the production of 1.4 MMtoe last year.

Incidentally, OVL had taken the 20 per cent stake in the project in July 2001 along with other oil majors Exxon Neftegas Ltd (ENL) and SODECO, a consortium of Japanese companies with 30 per cent participatory interest. ENL, which had been the operator, cut the production to entirely by September 2022 which took a massive toll on the OVL’s overall output.

The other major project, ONGC Videsh Vankorneft Pte. Ltd (OVVL), in which OVL has a 26 per cent stake, contributed 3.799 MMtoe to the company’s total production in FY’23. OVL expects a production enhancement of about five per cent in this project during the current financial year. However, the Dividend from the project is still an issue.

Indian oil companies are exploring the possibility of using close to $600 million of their dividend income stranded in Russia to buy oil from that country, officials said on September 14.

India's top four oil companies — Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), a unit of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd, Oil India Ltd and ONGC Videsh Ltd — haven't been able to repatriate dividend income they accrue from their investments in Russian oil and gas fields. That money is lying in their bank accounts in Russia but could not be brought to India due to tough Western sanctions that followed Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

This is at a time when Russia has emerged as the top crude oil supplier to India, accounting for more than a third of all purchases New Delhi makes from overseas.

Officials said one of the options could be to loan the money lying in Russian bank accounts to entities buying oil. These entities could repay the loan in India.

The entities that buy oil from Russia include IOC and BPCL.

""We are studying legal and financial implications of such a move,"" an official said. ""We are mindful of the sanctions and do not want to do anything that may in any way attract any breach."" Indian state oil firms have invested USD 5.46 billion in buying stakes in four different assets in Russia. These include a 49.9 per cent stake in the Vankorneft oil and gas field and another 29.9 per cent in the TAAS-Yuryakh Neftegazodobycha fields. They get dividends on profits made by the operating consortium from selling oil and gas produced from the fields.

Soon after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February last year, several major Russian banks were banned from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) financial transaction processing system, constricting Moscow's ability to access the global payments system.

Also, the Russian government has put restrictions on the repatriation of dollars from that country to check volatility in foreign exchange rates.

This led to a situation of dividend money getting stranded in Russia.

ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL), the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), holds a 26 per cent stake in Suzunskoye, Tagulskoye and Lodochnoye fields — collectively known as the Vankor cluster in the north-eastern part of the West Siberia.

Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Oil India Ltd (OIL) and Bharat PetroResources Ltd (a unit of Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd or BPCL) hold another 23.9 per cent in the same project. Russia's Rosneft is the operator with 50.1 per cent interest.

The consortium of OIL, IOC and Bharat PetroResources has a 29.9 per cent stake in TAAS-Yuryakh Neftegazodobycha.

Separately, OIL chairman and managing director Ranjit Rath said about USD 150 million of dividend income of OIL is lying in bank accounts in Russia.

The total for its consortium (IOC and BPRL included) is about USD 450 million, he said.

OVL has another USD 130 million of dividend income.

""We see this has a temporary phenomenon,"" Rath said. ""We are working at three levels — exploring legal options, analysing banking challenges and using government-to-government to negotiations."" He, however, refused to elaborate.

Other officials said the options being explored includes using the stranded money to buy oil.

""IOC as well as BPCL already are big buyers of Russian oil and perhaps they can use that money to buy oil,"" an official said. ""Legal and financial issues in doing so are currently being studied."" Another official said a solution is likely to emerge in 2-3 months' time.

The dividend is lying with the Commercial Indo Bank LLC (CIBL), which was a joint venture of the State Bank of India and Canara Bank. Canara Bank in March sold its 40 per cent stake in CIBL to SBI.

The dividend from TAAS was paid on a quarterly basis, while Vankorneft's earnings were paid half-yearly.

The Indian firms are looking at options of how to repatriate the money from Russia, Rath said.

All dividend income prior to the Ukraine war was repatriated but the one that accrued after that is stuck.

The operations of the fields have not been impacted and they continue to produce as normal, he added.

OVL also has a 20 per cent stake in the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas field in Far East Russia, and in 2009 acquired Imperial Energy, which has fields in Siberia, for USD 2.1 billion.

ONGC to invest up to Rs 2 trillion by 2038 to meet net-zero goals,ONGC to invest up to Rs 2 trillion by 2038 to meet net-zero goals,"Oil and Natural Gas Corp ( ONGC ) Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Arun Kumar Singh on Tuesday said the country’s top explorer would invest up to Rs 2 trillion by 2038 in two phases (Scope I and Scope II) to achieve emission targets.

These investments will involve components of green ammonia, hydrogen, solar, and other measures, he said. Click here to connect with us on WhatsApp

Scope I refers to emissions from direct company-owned and controlled resources. Scope II pertains to purchase of fossil fuel based electricity, cooling or heating solutions deployed by a company in its processes.

The company remains on track to scale up its renewable portfolio to 10 gigawatt (Gw) by 2030, Singh told the shareholders of the company at its annual general meeting earlier in the day.

The CEO said the upstream oil and gas sector had seen renewed vitality with various global majors scaling back plans to cut output.

“We now believe that the world is embracing conventional fuel “and, not or” renewable energy, unlike a few past years. India is likely to grow strong in Oil & Gas and renewables,” Singh said.

Overseas assets

Singh said the production level of the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas field in Russia had reached the level of about 180,000 barrels per day (bpd), very close to the pre-crisis production level of about 200,000 bpd.

The production timeline of other international assets of ONGC Videsh (OVL), the overseas arm of the company, in Colombia and Mozambique are also on track.

OVL owns a 20 per cent equity stake in the offshore Sakhalin-1 oil and gas field in the Russian Far East.

In response to international sanctions imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, Moscow had assigned the Sakhalin-1 project and operatorship to a regional subsidiary of Russian oil producer Rosneft.

Russia then asked foreign shareholders in the project, including American major Exxon and SODECO from Japan, to apply to reinstate their shareholdings in the project before mid-November.

ONGC officials said the company had subsequently applied and had its shareholding reinstated. The company expects smoother operations to soon push the levels beyond the pre-crisis level.

Singh said another of OVL’s major overseas assets, the Block CPO-5 in Colombia, was producing 17,000 bpd. “Two wells are presently awaiting regulatory approval and soon after production is expected to reach 25,000 bpd,” he said. Initially awarded to OVL in 2008, the bloc saw commercial oil being struck in 2020. OVL currently holds 70 per cent participating interest.

In Mozambique, where OVL is executing its largest project, the security situation continues to improve and construction boots are already on the ground, the chairman said. OVL holds 30 per cent in the $20 billion ‘Offshore Area 1’ project, which has been under force majeure since April 2021 following attacks by Islamic State terrorists. The revocation of the force majeure is expected soon, company officials said.

The company’s overall net profit could have been higher in FY23 had it not been for a provision of Rs 12,107 crore during Q4 on account of disputed ST/GST on royalty. ""However, the Company shall continue to contest such disputed matters before various forums,"" he stressed.

During 2022-23, the company attained its highest-ever standalone net profit of Rs 38,829 crore as against Rs 40,306 crore in the previous year.

Higher exploration, production

To further step up oil exploration, ONGC has deployed two drill ships and have commenced drilling of exploratory wells in the deep-sea of Mahanadi Basin of Eastern Offshore, Singh said.

The company has ordered 27 new-generation drilling rigs and 20 state-of-the-art hydraulic work-over rigs, of which 10 drilling and five work-over rigs have already been commissioned.

The company has also constituted an empowered in-house ‘Production Squad’ for rejuvenation of the Western Offshore oil block, he added.





Eyes on oil exploration

- 461 wells dug in FY23, up from 434 in FY22

- 77 wells from current and previous years tested

- 46 wells found to be hydrocarbon bearing with a 60% success rate ONGC is also collaborating with other entities to explore opportunities in the oil to chemical (O2C), refining, and petrochemicals value chains by setting up two greenfield O2C plants.

- 8 new major hydrocarbon discoveries notified

- 4 high pressure, high temperature wells in KG Basin and Mumbai Offshore dug

NEW DELHI: India's flagship overseas firm ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) has secured another three-year extension to explore oil and gas in a Vietnamese block in the contested waters of the South China Sea , the firm's parent ONGC said.This is the eighth extension for OVL, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC). The seventh extension to explore oil and gas was till June 15, 2023 and PTI on August 13 reported that the company was in talks with Vietnamese authorities for another three-year extension.OVL ""secures extension of 3 more years to explore in South China Sea's Block 128! India's strategic commitment stays strong as ONGC Videsh continues its exploration journey with its 8th extension till 15 June 2026,"" ONGC said in a post on social messaging platform X, formerly known as Twitter.The firm had in a proposal to regulator PVN sought a three-year extension of the exploration phase-1.""We are embracing challenges, safeguarding interests & fostering partnerships,"" ONGC said.The company has so far not found any commercially recoverable oil and gas reserves in the block in the 17 years it has been exploring there but has continued presence there because of India's strategic interest in the South China Sea.Vietnam too wants the Indian firm to counter China's interventions in the contested waters. OVL had signed a production sharing contract (PSC) with Vietnam's national oil firm PetroVietnam for deepwater exploratory Block- 128 having an area of 7,058 square kilometres in Offshore PhuKhanh Basin, Vietnam in May 2006.An investment licence was issued to it on June 16, 2006, thereby giving effect to the PSC. The firm completed the licence requirement of shooting 3D seismic data and reprocessing of 2D seismic data as well as drilling of the committed one well.Officials said OVL acquired 3D seismic data and reprocessed 2D seismic data to fulfil a part of the minimum work programme of the phase-1 of exploration period.Also, petroleum system modelling studies have been carried out based on data provided by PetroVietnam. OVL first took a two-year extension of the exploration period till June 2014 and then another for one year.A third extension was granted on May 28, 2015, and a fourth in 2016. It got the fifth extension for two years in 2017 and a sixth from June 16, 2019 to June 15, 2021.The seventh extension of two years was till June 15, 2023. Another official said the company had a couple of years ago drilled a well on the block but it could not reach the target depth and so it now has to drill the well all over again.The company has not found any hydrocarbon in the block but is continuing to stay invested to maintain India's strategic interest. The block lies in the part of the South China Sea over which China claims sovereignty.In 2011, Beijing had warned OVL that its exploration activities off the Vietnam coast were illegal and violated China's sovereignty, but the company continued exploring oil and gas.OVL made a foray into Vietnam as early as 1988 when it bagged the exploration licence for Block 06.1. OVL owns a 45 per cent stake in Block 06.1 and its share of condensate and oil equivalent gas production from the block was 0.693 million tonne during the 2022-23 fiscal.The production sharing contract (PSC) for Block 06.1 ws till May 18, 2023 but the Vietnam government has extended it for another 16 years.The 955 sq km Block 06.1 located in Nam Con Son basin has two producing fields -- Lan Tay and Lan Rosneft -- and has a 35 per cent stake while the remaining 20 per cent is with PetroVietnam.The firm in 2006 got two exploration blocks -- Block 127 and Block 128. While Block 127 was relinquished due to poor prospects, the other block was retained. The first extension for Block 128 followed China putting the area under the block for global bidding.",https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/oil-and-gas/ongc-videsh-secures-3-year-extension-for-vietnamese-oil-block-in-south-china-sea/102884957,"NEW DELHI: India's flagship overseas firm ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) has secured

Indian oil and gas company ONGC Videsh has secured a three-year extension from Vietnamese authorities for the exploration of ‘Block 128’.

The oil block is situated in the South China Sea’s disputed waters.

This is the eighth extension for ONGC Videsh, which is the overseas arm of Indian government-backed Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC).

In a post on X, formerly Twitter, ONGC announced, ONGC Videsh “secures extension of 3 more years to explore in South China Sea’s Block 128! India’s strategic commitment stays strong as ONGC Videsh continues its exploration journey with its 8th extension till 15 June 2026. We are embracing challenges, safeguarding interests & fostering partnerships.”

In May 2006, PetroVietnam, the state oil corporation of Vietnam, and ONGC Videsh agreed to a production sharing contract (PSC) for Block 128 offshore Phu Khanh Basin.

ONGC Videsh is yet to find commercially viable amount of oil and gas reserves in the block.

“Hon’ble Finance Minister approved upgradation of Oil India Ltd (OIL) to Maharatna CPSE (Central Public Sector Undertaking),” the Department of Heavy Enterprises under the Ministry of Finance posted on X, formerly Twitter, last week. “OIL will be the 13th Maharatna amongst the CPSEs.”

New Delhi: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman last week approved the elevation of two public sector oil companies — Oil India and ONGC Videsh — to the status of Maharatna and Navratna company, respectively. ThePrint looks into what this means for the two companies, and why these statuses are important for the growth of India’s public sector.

Genesis of this classification

The Navratna scheme was introduced in 1997, as part of the Common Minimum Programme of the United Front government at the time.

“The Common Minimum Programme of the Government states, inter-alia, that the government will identify public sector companies that have comparative advantages and support them in their drive to become global giants,” the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) said in an office memorandum issued in July 1997.

At the time, the office memorandum didn’t specify how the government would identify which companies would qualify as Navratnas, but over the years, it has finalised a formula where a company would be eligible for Navratna status if it scored 60 or above across six criteria that measured their current, past, and potential profitability and net worth.

The upshot of the scheme was to delegate several powers to the boards of these Navratna public sector companies to grant them greater independence and freedom to grow and expand their market presence.

These delegated powers included the authority to make decisions relating to capital expenditure without any monetary ceiling, to enter into technology joint ventures or strategic alliances, to purchase technology and know-how, and to implement organisational restructuring as they saw fit — including the creation or winding up of posts — among other facets of company-level decision-making.

This freedom came with several conditions aimed at improving corporate governance in these companies, including providing adequate time to the board of directors to consider a decision, mandating the presence of the board members when decisions are taken, and also suggesting that all decisions be taken by consensus as far as possible.

“With the grant of autonomy and the measures taken for restructuring of the PSE (public sector enterprise) boards, it is necessary that monitoring of the performance of these PSEs is done with utmost seriousness,” the DPE said in a separate memorandum.

“In this regard, the government feels that the monitoring of the performance of the enterprises should be done primarily by their own boards,” the memorandum added, saying that the ministry in charge of each PSE should also continue to monitor its performance.

At the time, the government designated nine PSEs as Navratnas: Bharat Heavy Electricals, Bharat Petroleum Corporation, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, Indian Oil Corporation, Indian Petrochemicals Corporation, National Thermal Power Corporation, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Steel Authority of India and Videsh Sanchar Nigam. Since then, this list has changed considerably, with several companies being upgraded to Maharatna status, which was introduced later, and other companies being included in the Navratna list.

At present — including the latest addition of ONGC Videsh and Oil India’s upgrade to Maharatna status — there are 13 Navratna companies, the others including Bharat Electronics Limited, Container Corporation of India, Engineers India, Hindustan Aeronautics, Mahanagar Telephone Nigam, National Aluminium Company, National Buildings Construction Corporation, Neyveli Lignite Corporation, NMDC, Rail Vikas Nigam, Rashtriya Ispat Nigam, and Shipping Corporation of India.

What about smaller companies?

Later in 1997, the government also introduced the Miniratna scheme, aimed at two categories of public sector enterprises. The first category was for PSEs that had continuously made a profit in the preceding three years, and with a pre-tax profit of at least Rs 30 crore or more in at least one of the three years, with a positive net worth. The second category included those PSEs that had made a profit for the previous three years continuously and with a positive net worth. The difference lay in the stipulation of the pre-tax profit.

The difference between Navratnas and Miniratnas was that the latter, while given more freedom than most other PSEs, were more constrained than Navratnas. For example, on capital expenditure, Miniratnas could make independent decisions only up to a certain cap — Rs 300 crore for Category 1 and Rs 150 crore for Category II. Above this, they had to seek the government’s permission.

Similarly, there were limits imposed on their freedoms regarding joint ventures, overseas offices, and human resource management.

According to data with the Department of Public Enterprises, there are currently 73 companies with Miniratna status.

How did Maharatnas come about?

With the Indian economy growing strongly in the years following the creation of Navratnas, several public sector companies also saw significant growth in their size and presence. These companies, if they were to compete globally, needed even more freedom to make their own decisions.

The government obliged in 2010, with the Maharatna scheme.

“The objective of the Maharatna scheme is to delegate enhanced powers to the boards of identified large-sized Navratna CPSEs so as to facilitate expansion of their operations, both in domestic as well as global markets,” the DPE said in an office memorandum in February 2010.

Not just any Navratna could be upgraded to Maharatna status, however. They had to be listed on the stock exchanges in line with SEBI regulations, with an average annual turnover and net worth during the previous three years of more than Rs 25,000 crore and Rs 15,000 crore respectively.

Potential Maharatna companies also needed an average annual net profit after tax during the previous three years of more than Rs 5,000 crore, and “significant global presence or international operations”.

Not too many Navratnas make this cut. With the inclusion of Oil India, there are now 13 Maharatna companies. The others are: Bharat Heavy Electricals, Bharat Petroleum Corporation, Coal India, GAIL India, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, Indian Oil Corporation, NTPC, Oil & Natural Gas Corporation, Power Finance Corporation, Power Grid Corporation of India, Rural Electrification Corporation, and Steel Authority of India.

What additional freedoms do Maharatnas get?

The bar set for becoming a Maharatna company was so high that the eligible companies were almost automatically global-level competitors, and so their corporate freedoms had to be enhanced accordingly in order for them to effectively compete internationally.

They start off with all the relaxations provided to Navratna companies, but can also raise debt domestically and internationally (up to a limit) without seeking government permission, can make equity investments, and decide on mergers and acquisitions, among other corporate governance freedoms.

However, with these freedoms came even greater scrutiny.

“The performance of Maharatna CPSEs would be reviewed annually by the Inter-Ministerial Committee, and thereafter by the Apex Committee headed by the cabinet secretary which will recommend continuation/divestment of Maharatna status,” the office memorandum said.

‘Navaratna’ Status","Being elevated to the Maharatna status is a significant milestone for Oil India Limited (OIL), a state-run oil and gas company in India. The decision to grant Maharatna status to OIL was made based on the recommendation from the Finance Ministry of the Indian government.

The Maharatna status is a prestigious recognition conferred upon select Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) in India. To achieve Maharatna status, a CPSE must meet certain criteria set by the government. Some of the key criteria include:

1. Listing on Stock Exchange: The CPSE should be listed on Indian stock exchanges.

2. Net Worth: The CPSE should have a minimum average annual net worth of Rs. 15,000 crore for the last three years.

3. Profitability: The CPSE should have an average annual net profit after tax of at least Rs. 5,000 crore for the last three years.

4. Global Operations: The CPSE should have significant global operations or international presence.

5. Significant Projects: The CPSE should have undertaken projects of considerable size and scale, either in India or abroad.

6. Subsidiaries: The CPSE should have a minimum of three fully-owned and independent subsidiaries or joint ventures.

Once a CPSE is granted the Maharatna status, it gains greater financial autonomy, which allows it to take important business decisions without seeking government approval for investments up to a certain limit. This increased autonomy enables Maharatna CPSEs to pursue growth opportunities, invest in new projects, and expand their business operations more effectively.

By becoming the 13th Maharatna CPSE, Oil India Limited joins an elite group of public sector enterprises that have demonstrated exceptional performance and contributed significantly to the Indian economy. This recognition reflects the company’s achievements, financial strength, and strategic importance in the energy sector.

The Maharatna status will further strengthen Oil India Limited’s position in the market and empower it to play a more significant role in meeting India’s energy needs and contributing to the nation’s growth and development.

The decision to elevate the status of Oil India Limited (OIL) to Maharatna CPSE is aimed at enhancing the powers of the OIL board when it comes to making financial decisions. The move was approved by the Finance Minister of India.

The Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) shared the news on Twitter, stating that OIL would become the 13th Maharatna CPSE. OIL is a Central Public Sector Enterprise under the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas. It has achieved significant financial success, with an annual turnover of ₹41,039 crore and a net profit of ₹9,854 crore for the Year 2022-23.

By being elevated to Maharatna status, OIL will gain greater financial autonomy, allowing its board to make important financial decisions without seeking prior approval from the government for investments up to a certain limit. This increased autonomy is expected to empower OIL to pursue strategic initiatives, undertake major projects, and expand its operations more efficiently.

The move is a recognition of OIL’s strong financial performance and its significant contribution to the energy sector in India. With its new Maharatna status, OIL is expected to play a more prominent role in meeting the nation’s energy needs and supporting India’s economic growth and development.

The Finance Ministry of the Indian government has approved the upgradation of Oil and Natural Gas Company (ONGC) Videsh Ltd (OVL) to the status of Navaratna Company. The Department of Public Enterprises shared this information, stating that OVL would become the 14th Navaratna CPSE (Central Public Sector Enterprise).

ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) is a Central Public Sector Enterprise under the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas. It is primarily engaged in overseas exploration and production activities in the oil and gas sector. OVL has demonstrated strong financial performance, with an annual turnover of ₹11,676 crore and a net profit of ₹1,700 crore for the Year 2022-23.

By being elevated to the Navaratna status, OVL will gain enhanced financial and operational autonomy. The Navaratna status allows its board to make important financial decisions independently, up to a certain limit, without requiring prior approval from the government. This increased autonomy will enable OVL to pursue international business opportunities, undertake significant projects, and expand its global presence more efficiently.

The decision to grant Navaratna status to OVL reflects its success in overseas operations and its strategic importance in the energy sector. With this recognition, OVL is expected to strengthen India’s presence in the global oil and gas industry and contribute to the country’s energy security and economic growth.

As of August 4, 2023, the Finance Ministry of the Indian government has elevated Oil India Limited (OIL) to the status of the 13th ‘Maharatna’ company and Oil and Natural Gas Company (ONGC) Videsh Ltd (OVL) to the status of a ‘Navaratna’ company.

For Oil India Limited (OIL), the elevation to Maharatna status means that the company’s board will gain increased powers in making financial decisions, providing the company with greater financial autonomy. OIL is a state-run oil major and a Central Public Sector Enterprise (CPSE) under the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas. It reported an annual turnover of ₹41,039 crore and a net profit of ₹9,854 crore for the Year 2022-23.

On the other hand, ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL), the overseas arm and wholly-owned subsidiary of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC), has been granted the Navaratna status. This status empowers OVL with enhanced financial and operational freedom, allowing the company to invest up to ₹1,000 crore or 15% of its net worth in a single project without seeking government approval. OVL is also a CPSE under the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, with an annual turnover of ₹11,676 crore and a net profit of ₹1,700 crore for the Year 2022-23.

The Maharatna and Navaratna statuses are prestigious designations given to select CPSEs in India, which grant them greater decision-making powers and financial autonomy to foster growth and expansion. Companies with these statuses are expected to play a significant role in their respective sectors and contribute to the nation’s economic development.

The list of Maharatna CPSEs includes companies such as Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), Coal India Limited, GAIL India Limited, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL), Indian Oil Corporation Limited, NTPC Limited, Power Finance Corporation, Power Grid Corporation of India Limited, Rural Electrification Corporation Limited, and Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL).

To be eligible for the Maharatna status, a company should have an average turnover of over ₹25,000 crore, an average annual net worth of more than ₹15,000 crore, and an average annual net profit of over ₹5,000 crore during the last three years.

"Draft contract improved to attract more foreign firms to offshore gas 
exploration","Draft contract improved to attract more foreign firms to offshore gas 
exploration","The government has approved the draft of a new Production Sharing Contract model with an aim to attract more international oil and gas companies for the exploration of gas and oil in the country's offshore areas.

The ""Draft Bangladesh Offshore Model Production Sharing Contract (PSC) 2023"" was approved yesterday at the 16th meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs.

The new model has been fine-tuned bringing several changes to the old formula, according to Petrobangla sources.

This is the final approval to the draft model PSC 2023.

State-owned Petrobangla will now invite international bidding for hydrocarbon exploration in deep and shallow sea areas with this new PSC model.

Some international oil and gas companies have already proposed to explore the sea areas of Bangladesh.

Among them, US multinational ExxonMobil has offered to explore the entire deep and shallow sea area of Bangladesh.

However, since the PSC is not final, the government has not yet taken any decision on the proposal.

Gas price on Brent Crude

In the new contract model, the international market price of Brent Crude will determine gas price. Foreign companies will be offered 10% of Brent Crude price for 1,000 cubic feet of gas.

In the existing PSC, the price of shallow and deep sea gas production was fixed at $5.60 and $7.25 respectively.

The model also improves cost recovery share for hydrocarbons from shallow sea blocs from 55% to 70%.

Under a Model PSC, normally, if any international oil company (IOC) discovers gas, it gets a 40% stake while the government obtains the remaining 60%, adds UNB.

The government also buys the IOC's gas at a certain price. So if the gas price is raised, IOCs feel encouraged to invest in exploration work.

The country has a total of 48 blocks, of which 26 are located offshore. Of the 26 offshore blocks, 11 are located in shallow sea (SS) water while 15 are located in deep sea (DS) water areas, UNB reports citing official sources.

Of these, 24 offshore gas blocks remain open for IOCs while two blocks—SS-04 and SS-09–are under contract with a joint venture of ONGC Videsh Ltd and Oil India Ltd where drilling works have recently started.

Currently, about 2300 mmcfd gas is being produced from 22 gas fields in the country, while about 700 mmcfd gas is being imported from abroad to meet the demand of about 4000 mmcfd, leaving a deficit of about 1000 mmcfd.

The new proposal has been prepared as per the recommendations of a Scottish consultancy firm, Wood Mackenzie, which was appointed last year to work out the new plan for Petrobangla to attract international bidding from IOCs.

Other approvals

Meanwhile, the Cabinet Committee on Government Purchase has approved a total of 13 proposals worth Tk18,480 crore.

The Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) will import 16.80 lakh tonnes of refined oil at Tk12,850 crore for the rest of this year.

The fuel will be imported from six state-owned companies in Thailand, UAE, China, Indonesia and Malaysia.

Besides, the committee has also approved the purchase of 8,000 tonnes of lentils for Tk75.59 crore, and 80 lakh tonnes of soybean oil for Tk131.16 crore.

"Without Sakhalin-1 stake’ equity rights, OVL losing out on dividends | 
Company Business News","Without Sakhalin-1 stake’ equity rights, OVL losing out on dividends","New Delhi: With state run ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) yet to get the equity rights for its shares in Sakhalin-1, the overseas arm of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has not received any dividend payments, said two people aware of the development.

The issue of India’s most lucrative energy equity buy overseas has been raised with Rosneft and at various levels in the Russian government but is yet to be resolved. The stake sale was purchased ONGC’s subsidiary for $331 million in 2001 that has yielded manifold returns. Rosneft on its part has invested around $13 billion in India.

Mint reported on 21 April about Russia’s Rosneft offering dividend payments to OVL as against its 20% stake in Sakhalin-1, which was earlier the source of lucrative equity oil for India. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Moscow seized the Sakhalin-1 asset through a presidential decree in October last year and gave it to Rosneft subsidiary —Sakhalinmorneftegaz-shelf— resulting in ExxonMobil, the operator of the asset exiting Russia. ExxonMobil owned a 30% stake in the asset spread over 1140 square km, Japan’s Sakhalin Oil and Gas Development Co. held 30% in the project, with Rosneft units holding the remaining 20%. Post the Russian presidential decree, while OVL received its previous shareholding in Sakhalin-1, the shares are yet to be transferred to it. In the absence of share’ ownership, OVL is not getting the dividend.

“While we earlier used to get equity oil for our stake in Sakhalin-1, we were offered dividends. Given that our share has not been transferred back to us, presently we are neither getting dividend, nor any equity energy from there,” said one of the two people cited above requesting anonymity.

Queries emailed to the spokespersons of Rosneft, Russian Federation embassy in New Delhi, India’s ministries of external affairs, and petroleum and natural gas, and OVL on 18 July remained unanswered till press time.

Also, Indian state-run energy firms including OVL, Bharat Petroresources Ltd, Indian Oil Corp, and Oil India Ltd face approximately $400 million in dividend payments from from CSJC Vankorneft and LLC Taas-Yuryakh stuck in Russia given the difficulty in transferring dividend payments from Russia, as reported by Mint earlier.

A Rosneft spokesperson in an earlier 19 April response said, “In early October, in accordance with the presidential decree, a new Russian legal entity was created to manage the asset and resume full-scale operations in accordance with Russian law. At the same time, the opportunity was preserved for all existing shareholders to participate in the new project in proportion to their pre-existing interests in the Sakhalin-1 project. The only condition for continued participation was the formation of a liquidation fund for the project in the Russian Federation, previously organized by Exxon in Great Britain. The Indian partners have not fulfilled this condition for the time being.”",https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/without-sakhalin-1-stake-equity-rights-ovl-losing-out-on-dividends-11689963753820.html,"New Delhi: With state run ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) yet to get the equity

OVL Considers Resuming Operations in Block 20 in Iraq,OVL Considers Resuming Operations in Block 20 in Iraq,"OVL Considers Resuming Operations in Block 20 in Iraq

In recent years, Iraq has solidified its position as a major supplier of crude oil to India, strengthening bilateral ties between the two nations. The state-run company, ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL), is now considering the resumption of operations in its hydrocarbon exploration block in Iraq, which has been under force majeure since 2003. This development comes as India looks to expand its energy partnerships and explore investment opportunities in Iraq’s oil and gas sector.

Iraq: A Major Crude Oil Supplier to India

Iraq has emerged as a significant supplier of crude oil to India in recent times. With its abundant oil reserves and favorable trade relations, Iraq has become a vital source of energy for India’s growing demands. In the fiscal year FY23, Iraq stood as the second-largest exporter of crude oil to India, providing a total of 50.31 million tonnes worth $33.37 billion. This demonstrates the importance of Iraq’s oil supply to India’s energy security and economic growth.

Resuming Operations: OVL’s Exploration Block in Iraq

ONGC Videsh Ltd’s hydrocarbon exploration block in Iraq, known as Block 20 (formerly Block 8), has been under force majeure since 2003 due to security concerns. However, there are now discussions about the possibility of resuming operations in the block. The decision to resume operations will depend on several factors, including the security situation and other aspects that require clarity. OVL’s potential return to the exploration block indicates India’s commitment to expanding its energy investments and strengthening ties with Iraq.

Exploring Investment Opportunities

During the India-Iraq Joint Commission Meeting (JCM) held last month, investment opportunities in Iraq’s oil and gas sector were discussed. The JCM highlighted the mutual desire to enhance cooperation and explore avenues for investment. India expressed its readiness to invest in Iraq’s rehabilitation projects and emphasized the potential for increased quantities of crude oil imports based on appropriate pricing regimes. These discussions reflect India’s intent to deepen its energy engagement with Iraq and pave the way for long-term collaboration.

LNG Terminal Plans and Future Prospects

India is also planning to construct a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Iraq. The terminal aims to harness Iraq’s gas resources by liquefying the currently flared gas and transporting it to India for various sectors such as city gas distribution, power, fertilizer, and steel. This venture not only contributes to energy diversification but also strengthens the trade and economic cooperation between the two countries.

India to resume operations at stalled hydrocarbon block in Iraq | Today News,India to resume operations at stalled hydrocarbon block in Iraq,"NEW DELHI : At a time when Iraq has emerged as a major supplier of crude oil to India, the Centre is looking at resuming operations of state-run ONGC Videsh Ltd’s (OVL) hydrocarbon exploration block in Iraq, which has been under force majeure since 2003, said two people with knowledge of the development.

One of the persons said Indian energy companies may look at investing in oil and gas assets in the West Asian country.

“Several aspects would be considered for resumption of operations at the stalled project and investments, including the security situation. There are some issues on which clarity would be required,"" said this person.

‘Block 20’, earlier known as Block 8, is a large on-land exploration block in the Western Desert of Iraq, spread over 10,500 sq km. OVL had acquired 100% stake in the block by signing the exploration and development contract in November 2000, However, force majeure was declared in 2003 amid security concerns.

Force majeure is removes liability for unforeseeable and unavoidable catastrophes that prevent participants from fulfilling contractual obligations.

Both the subjects of investments and resumption of operations at the stalled projects were discussed during an India-Iraq Joint Commission Meeting (JCM) last month.

The JCM was held during the visit of Hayan Abdul Ghani Abdul Zahra Al Sawad, Iraq’s deputy prime minister for energy affairs and oil minister. A petroleum ministry statement had said that during the meeting, union minister for petroleum and natural gas Hardeep Singh Puri highlighted the natural and traditional synergies between the two countries on account of India’s position as a growing energy demand centre of the world.

He called for strengthening relations between the two sides, including in oil and gas, capacity-building and diversification of the trade basket. The JCM was held after a gap of 10 years.

He also underlined the readiness of Indian companies to explore investment opportunities in Iraq, the upgradation of infrastructure facilities of the oil and gas sector and their amenability for sourcing increased quantities of crude oil from Iraq based on appropriate pricing regime.

The Iraqi minister expressed his government’s desire to welcome Indian companies to invest in Iraq, including in rehabilitation projects.

On 12 June, Mint reported that India is planning to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Iraq. The terminal will liquify some portion of the gas currently flared by Iraq and transport it to India, where it will be converted back to LNG for use in city gas distribution as well as power, fertilizer, and steel sectors.

In FY23, Iraq was the second largest exporter of crude oil to India, with total supplies of 50.31 million tonnes for $33.37 billion. It was the topmost supplier in value terms.

ONGC Videsh reconsiders its plan to buy stake in Kenya oil project,ONGC Videsh reconsiders its plan to buy stake in Kenya oil project,"By Paul Burkhardt and Rakesh Sharma



ONGC Videsh Ltd. is reconsidering taking a stake in Tullow Oil Plc’s Kenya assets following the exit of other partners in the project.



The Indian oil company needs more clarity after TotalEnergies SE and Africa Oil Corp. quit the Kenya consortium several weeks ago, an ONGC executive, who asked not to be named because the information was private, told reporters on Tuesday. ONGC and Oil India Ltd.’s discussions with Tullow started before these companies decided to exit.

Tullow discovered crude oil in Kenya in 2012, but has yet to find strategic partners that would unlock sufficient funding for the project. The country’s government also has yet to approve a development plan for the resources.

Tullow said there are still potential strategic partners for the Kenya venture, without naming any companies.

“The prospective partners remain engaged and detailed farm-out discussions continue with a number of companies,” a Tullow spokesperson said by email. The company remains focused on securing a partnership this year.

An Oil India spokesman said the company is “still evaluating” taking a stake in the Kenya project.",https://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/ongc-videsh-reconsiders-its-plan-to-buy-stake-in-kenya-oil-project-123070500165_1.html,"ONGC Stakes in Kenya Oil: The Indian oil company needs more clarity after

ONGC Videsh, a wholly-owned subsidiary of India’s Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), is reconsidering buying a stake in Tullow Oil’s assets in Kenya, reported Bloomberg.

An ONGC executive told the publication that the company needs more clarity on the oil blocks in South Lokichar Basin onshore Kenya.

In May this year, TotalEnergies and Africa Oil exited the project due to “differing internal strategic reasons”, leaving Tullow as the sole owner of the assets.

ONGC and Oil India were already in talks with Tullow for a stake before TotalEnergies and Africa Oil each decided to give up their 25% stake in the oil field.

Tullow found crude oil in Kenya in 2012 but has yet to onboard key partners who could provide funding for the project.

A plan for developing the resources is also yet to be approved by the Kenyan government.

OVL rejigs its strategy; opts for producing assets in near term,OVL rejigs its strategy; opts for producing assets in near term,"The much talked about term today is “energy security” and with changing dynamics globally, companies in oil and gas exploration business need to not only have a higher level of risk appetite but also be mindful of the geopolitical situation. The situation has led almost all explorers (upstream segment of the business) to restrategise their business and in sync with this shift, ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL), the wholly-owned subsidiary and overseas arm of ONGC, India’s flagship National Oil Company, has also worked around its strategy and is looking at acquiring more producing or near-term producing fields rather than rank exploratory ones.

OVL, which has major investments in Russia, is acutely aware of the challenges due to the present geo-political environment. “We are aware of the challenges. Keeping in mind the investments we have there (in Russia), we are confident that we can work with our partners in order to maintain asset integrity and stabilise production at the optimum level,” Rajarshi Gupta, Managing Director, OVL, said.

In a quick chat with businessline, Gupta shared his thoughts on the way forward and that the company would surely look keenly at exploration acreages if the materiality, fiscal terms, conditions & stability, and political situation are conducive to make these kinds of long-term investments. Excerpts:

Q Most of the oil explorers have rejigged their investment strategy and are going for acquiring producing assets. Has OVL also reworked its business strategy?

Our primary business is Exploration & Production (E&P). But, with changing geo-political dynamics and like most others, we too had to re-look at our business strategy, especially from the standpoint of anticipated change in the global energy mix, rapid growth in renewables, ESG goals, besides intrinsic challenges in the E&P space.

In the exploration business and for an onshore acreage, the gestation period from initial exploration, including seismic data acquisition, processing, interpretation, drilling, facilities, and development, till the production and sales stage, is anywhere between 6-8 years and for offshore it is 9-12 years. During this time frame and in executing the various processes, if the geo-political environment of the investment changes, there could be a significant risk. Additionally, there are risks of fiscal instability, price volatility, and demand uncertainty, besides other execution risks.

Agreed, that exploration is a risk-taking business, but a lot of issues have to be kept in mind before committing funds toward large and long-term investments. Even today, OVL has 8-9 active exploration blocks. But, in near term it would look at acquiring stakes in producing or near-term producing fields.

A decision on whether to go ahead with exploration acreage would principally depend on the subsurface materiality, fiscal conditions, geopolitical stability, and strategic fit which are being offered, besides the geo-political situation in the larger region.

Currently, OVL owns participating interests in 32 oil and gas assets in 15 countries. Till now OVL has maintained a balanced portfolio approach and maintains a combination of producing, discovering, exploring, and pipeline assets. OVL, at present, produces from 14 Assets, 4 Assets where hydrocarbons have been discovered and are at various stages of development, 11 Assets are under various stages of Exploration and 3 are pipeline projects.

In FY 2021-22 the production of oil and oil equivalent of gas (O+OEG) was 12.33 MMtoe, which declined to 10.171 MMtoe in 2022-23. This decrease has mainly been due to force majeure conditions in Russia, extensive floods in South Sudan, licence expiry in a producing asset in Colombia as well as outages in a few other producing assets.

Q OVL has less than $100 million of dividend income lying in Russia because of Ukraine conflict, but the company is not in a hurry to bring it back. OVL has so far invested considerable amounts in buying stakes in three different assets in Russia — 26 per cent stake in the Vankorneft oil and gas field, 20 per cent in Sakhalin – I , besides it also owns Imperial Energy Corporation. You also mentioned some banking challenges. What are the challenges that still remain?

At present trade between India and Russia has increased and the quantum of proceeds from the trade has also commensurately increased. By comparison, our dividend amount is modest. OVL gets dividends on profits made by the operating consortium from selling oil and gas produced from the fields. Though there do exist some restrictions on repatriation of funds, we remain invested and are optimistic of an early and satisfactory resolution.

The dividend amount is parked in our accounts in Russia and there is no challenge there. Besides, we do have major investments in Russia and need funds to run our setups there. Therefore, there is no urgency to move it. However, in the eventuality that we do need to move the funds, then we would need to look at suitable banking channels. We are in close collaboration with our partners and operator in Russia, and we remain invested in the country for synergistic growth in our quest for energy security.

Q Talking about Russia, what is the status on Imperial? You were looking for a technical partner there? Will you offer equity in the asset to the partner?

We are producing from Imperial. At present, it is business as usual for us there, but yes, we were looking at partners with expertise. In fact, we progressed on that front in 2021 and in early 2022 had reached a fairly decisive level, but then in between things came to a standstill due to a changed geo-political scenario. We are relooking at this endeavour of bringing in a suitable strategic partner but this would take about 12-18 months for fruition. We seek local partners who have the technical, operational, and domain expertise. As regards how will the partnership work out, it is still early days, we can consider from a basket of options.

Q How would you evaluate the present health of OVL? What are your growth plans?

OVL has faced significant business challenges in the past year affecting its portfolio right from geo-political events, increased regulatory oversight, tightening fiscal regime, unprecedented floods (once-in-a-century, two years in a row) affecting operations, and ageing fields which has reflected in its declining production.

We are currently in a consolidation phase but expect to organically grow over the next 4-5 years by about 4.5 MMtoe once our offshore assets in Mozambique and Brazil commence production. We are also very optimistic about block CPO-5, our operated project in Colombia where we believe significant upsides exist. We have also obtained extensions in exploration licence periods in South Sudan, Colombia, Bangladesh, Myanmar; in Vietnam, we have had licence validity of a producing field extended. With all these steps we expect to organically grow our production number by almost 60 per cent from the present level in the next 6 years.

The international oil and gas M&A space has evolved in the past few years, with diminished appetite for risk, hence more competition for clean-flowing barrels. This, coupled with energy transition, ESG, green financing, has actually increased competitive pressures for quality barrels.",https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/ovl-rejigs-its-strategy-opts-for-producing-assets-in-near-term/article66930384.ece,"OVL, which has major investments in Russia, is acutely aware of the

ONGC to become Net Zero by 2038,ONGC to become Net Zero by 2038,"Oil Natural Gas Commission (ONGC) will become Net-Zero by 2038 and invest Rs 1 lakh crore by 2030 on energy transition projects to reduce carbon emissions, Arun Kumar Singh, Chairman & CEO, ONGC announced during an interaction with the journalists in Mumbai on 29 May 2023.

By doing so, the Energy Maharatna will prepare roadmaps for net zero emissions as part of the nation's commitment to deal with the climate challenge crisis. ""We have done our internal workings and are now confident that we can achieve net-zero for Scope-1 and Scope-2 emissions by 2038,"" Singh told journalists here.

After declaring its Annual Financial Results (AFR) for FY 2022-23 on 26 May 2023, Chairman and the Directors of ONGC, MD and Directors of subsidiaries ONGC Videsh Ltd. and MRPL, held an hour-long discussion with journalists, sharing the performance and strategic future plans of the Energy Maharatna and its group of companies in the coming years.

The session was held in a hybrid mode at the Grand Ballroom of JW Marriott, Sahar in Mumbai, whereby senior journalists from the oil and gas beat joined in-person in Mumbai as well as online from across the country. Besides Chairman and CEO Arun Kumar Singh, Director (T&FS) Om Prakash Singh, Director (Production) Pankaj Kumar, Director (Finance) Pomila Jaspal, Director (Exploration) Sushma Rawat, MD-ONGC Videsh (OVL) Rajarshi Gupta and MD-MRPL M Venkatesh responded to the media queries. The journalists evinced keen interest in the state-owned energy giant as the interactive session unfolded itself.

After an introductory welcome anchored by CGM-Chief CC Debasish Mukherjee, ED-Chief Corporate Strategy and Planning Pavan Aggarwal delivered a presentation featuring the corporate highlights and growth plans of the ONGC Group. The presentation brought out that the Energy Maharatna has been among the top CPSEs in terms of market capitalization. The company posted gross revenue of Rs 1,55,517 crores in FY 2023, up by 41% from the previous fiscal year, along with the highest-ever total dividend worth 225%; i.e. Rs 11.25 per share. Additionally, highlights of ONGC Videsh were also presented along with those of other group companies like MRPL, HPCL, and other value-chain companies.

The presentation was followed by an engaging interactive session with the journalists. Responding to a query on production restrictions imposed due to regulations from the Directorate General of Shipping, Government of India, Chairman said that ONGC is awaiting a nod from the International Association of Drilling Contractors (IADC). “We are looking for a solution to it. Hope we’ll reach that very soon. One has to see the production ratio in a global context. Rig manufacturing takes time. Being a responsible Corporate, we have asked for a five-year time.”

Deliberating further, Singh added that the KG basin gas block is one of the primary focus areas of ONGC. “Our revenue scheme is very vast in terms of resource requirements for ONGC. From a financial point of view and cash flow, we are stable enough unless there is a policy change any further. As much as Rs 61,200 crore is being invested in 14 development and nine infrastructure projects including KG gas field and rejuvenation of existing producing fields like Mumbai High North and Heera.” He informed that the Gas story for ONGC is very strong. “Revenue from Gas will go up in the near future.”

In the aftermath of the prolonged Russian war on Ukraine, queries were also raised on OVL’s share of dividends in Russia, which MD-OVL narrowed to less than USD 100 million. He assured that the state-owned energy giant is not in a hurry as the company has capital and operating expenses for three projects in Russia. “We have our own Capex requirements. We had near-zero production from Sakhalin almost a year ago. Now, we however have got back our 20% stake from the new Russian operator. It is business as usual as far as dividend is concerned.”

It should be noted that the production from Sakhalin-1 stopped in April 2022 after Exxon Neftegaz, its previous operator, declared force majeure at the project in response to international sanctions imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. Moscow assigned the Sakhalin-1 project and operatorship to a regional subsidiary of Russian oil producer Rosneft. Russia then asked foreign shareholders in the project, including ONGC Videsh, to apply to reinstate their shareholdings in the project before mid-November 2022.

Replying to further queries, the Board Members on the dais also added that the Government of India is ramping up efforts to resume operations at a gas project in a terrorist-affected province of Mozambique where an ONGC Videsh holds a 30% stake. “Work has re-started in the prolific Mozambique field. The production will probably begin by 2026-27,” Singh exclaimed.

Talking about a significant reduction in profit margin compared to FY’21, Chairman specified the loss for a contested tax liability introduced by the Service Tax department. The payment of service tax on royalty by the company is a legally contested issue. If the provision is altered then the money will reflect in ONGC’s book. Crude Oil pricing definitely has a role to play, but the legal complications are the major factors affecting the company.”

However, in order to overcome the surprise loss, ONGC is looking forward to seeking additional measures, such as the OALP rounds. “OALP is our future. The 9th to 12th rounds will give us the blocks. So, let’s hope for the best. In addition, MRPL and OPaL are strongly engaged in the diversification plan from oil to the petro-chemical sector. Diversification means the expansion of these facilities in these plants,” Chairman said further.

Adding to his point, Director (Exploration) noted, “Optimism is very important at this juncture. We’ll be looking into acreages, also in the NE region. We’ll be using technologies, especially in the areas with more gas flows and sustained production. Category –II basins are highly productive. We have inked MoUs with several organizations like ExxonMobil for deepwater explorations. Joint studies are being carried out, including acreages in Cauvery & Krishna-Godavari basin. They are also curious about Mahanadi. We are sure of finding prospects there as well.”

The company, which has 1.62 lakh square kilometers of acreage, is looking to take the acreage to 5 lakh square kilometers by acquiring one lakh square km every year, spending Rs 10,000 crore annually on exploration.

Director (T&FS) further highlighted that the entire ONGC team is very motivated. “We have taken baby steps in technology up-gradation, like TL fuel engines, a combination of SSP & gas, and HSP in the drilling rigs. We are continuously looking out for prospects of relying more on green energy and reducing carbon emissions.”

Replying to a question on increasing the renewables potential to 10 GW capacity, Chairman asserted that ONGC will be a net-zero company by 2038. “We have done our internal workings and are now confident that we can achieve net-zero for Scope-1 and Scope-2 emissions by 2038. We are focused on the round-the-clock (RTC) issue. A team is working on it. 5 GW of solar power, green ammonia, and wind energy, everything is on the table.”

The company is planning to scale up electricity generation from renewable sources from 189 MW to 1 GW by 2030. It already has 5 GW of project planned in Rajasthan and is scouting for a similar capacity, he said adding ONGC would also look at offshore wind farms.

It is also looking at setting up a 1 million tonne per annum green ammonia plant at Mangalore.

“Overall, the investments will be of the order of Rs 1 lakh crores,” he said.

The media interaction comes after the weekend following ONGC’s Board of Directors held their meeting on 26 May, 2023 approving the annual results for FY’23. The company reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 5,701 crores, down by 53%, compared to Rs 12,061 crore in the corresponding period last year. The state-run petroleum giant's revenue from operations during the January-March quarter stood at Rs 164,066.72 crore, registering a growth of five per cent, compared to Rs 155,946.99 crore in the year-ago period.

Overall, ONGC's crude output is also likely to rise to 21.263 MT in the current fiscal (April 2023 to March 2024), 21.525 MT in 2024-25 and 22.389 MT in the following fiscal. Meanwhile, the natural gas output is slated to rise from 20.636 billion cubic meters (bcm) in 2022-23, 23.621 bcm in 2023-24, 26.08 bcm in the following year and 27.16 bcm in 2025-26.",https://www.indianchemicalnews.com/petro-chemical/ongc-to-become-net-zero-by-2038-17688,"Oil Natural Gas Commission (ONGC) will become Net-Zero by 2038 and invest

India's flagship overseas firm ONGC Videsh has less than USD 100 million of dividend income lying in Russia because of Ukraine conflict but the company is not in a hurry to bring it back, a senior official said on Monday.Indian state oil firms have invested USD 5.46 billion in buying stakes in four different assets in Russia. These include a 49.9 per cent stake in the Vankorneft oil and gas field and another 29.9 per cent in the TAAS-Yuryakh Neftegazodobycha fields.They get dividends on profits made by the operating consortium from selling oil and gas produced from the fields. Soon after invading Ukraine in February last year, Russia put restrictions on repatriation of dollars to check volatility in foreign exchange rates.OVL, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), got its last dividend back in July 2022. One dividend payout that came after that is lying in the company's account in Russia.Its managing director Rajarshi Gupta said the dividend income lying in Russia is ""less than USD 100 million.""""We are not in a hurry to get it back as the company has capital and operating expenses for the three projects in Russia,"" he said.

India's flagship overseas oil firm ONGC Videsh has got a new partner in Oil India Ltd to replace a reluctant IndianOil ( IOC ) for the potential acquisition of a 50 per cent stake in Tullow Oil Plc 's USD 3.4 billion oilfield project in Kenya, according to people with knowledge of the matter. But the OVL-OIL duo now faces competition from super-aggressive Chinese energy giant Sinopec which has entered the fray taking advantage of the delay on the Indian part in finalising the deal.Originally, ONGC Videsh, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), was interested in buying out half of the stakes that Tullow, Africa Oil Corp and TotalEnergies SE held in the Lokichar oilfield in Kenya.The board of OVL had approved the deal, sources said adding the firm however wanted to bring on board IOC, which too had shown interest in the project.For months, OVL-IOC negotiated the stake in the project. But the transaction couldn't be completed as IOC started having second thoughts, possibly due to financial strains resulting from losses on fuel sales.Sources said when a Kenyan ministerial delegation visited the India Energy Week in Bengaluru in February, the Indian side informed that IOC would not be going ahead and instead state-owned Oil India Ltd (OIL) will join in.However, the months of delays led to the Chinese sensing an opportunity. China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (Sinopec) is now sending fillers to Tullow and the other two partners in the project, they said.Tullow, which is headed by India-origin CEO Rahul Dhir, had originally favoured the Indian consortium as the Kenyan project and the Barmer fields in Rajasthan had a lot of similarities.As much as 70 per cent of the supply chain sourcing could have been done from India and Dhir, who as CEO of Cairn India Ltd had brought the Rajasthan fields to production more than a decade back, saw a lot of synergy, sources said.Chinese interest may however spoil the party as Beijing yields considerable influence on the African nation.The deal being negotiated by OVL-OIL would have made the Indian state-backed firms joint operators of the venture.Tullow is the present operator of the venture with 50 per cent stake. Africa Oil Corp and TotalEnergies SE have 25 per cent stake each. The three were selling half of their stakes to the Indians.OVL, an explorer with pursuits in 35 oil and gas assets in 15 nations, would be the lead on the venture, backed by OIL, the nation's second-largest state oil explorer.Kenya's south Lokichar fields in blocks 10BB and 13T are projected to produce 120,000 barrels of oil per day (6 million tonnes per annum), with anticipated gross oil restoration of 585 million barrels over the total lifetime of the sector.The waxy crude from the project, which is similar to what is produced from Barmer in Rajasthan, will be shipped from the fields by way of a 20-inch, 825-kilometer heated pipeline to a port in the archipelago of Lamu.Barmer crude oil too is transported through a 700-km heated pipeline from Barmer deserts to the Gujarat coast.Indian refiners on the west coast would have been ideal customers of the Kenyan crude, sources said adding it would take three years for the companies to start producing oil from the date the investment decision is made.The USD 3.4 billion investment includes developing the South Lokichar fields and linking them to Kenya's Indian Ocean port of Lamu via a heated pipeline.",https://m.economictimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/ongc-oil-india-in-talks-for-50-stake-in-3-4-bn-kenya-oilfield-chinese-firm-enters-fray/articleshow/100416407.cms,"India's flagship overseas oil firm ONGC Videsh has got a new partner in Oil

"Russia offers OVL dividend, not equity oil, for Sakhalin-1 stake | Today 
News","Russia offers OVL dividend, not equity oil, for Sakhalin-1 stake","Russia’s Rosneft has offered dividend payments to ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) as against its 20% stake in Sakhalin-1, which was earlier the source of lucrative equity oil for India.

Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Moscow seized the Sakhalin-1 asset through a presidential decree, resulting in ExxonMobil, the operator of the asset, exiting Russia. ExxonMobil owned a 30% stake in the asset that was valued at over $4 billion.

While ONGC Videsh has regained its stake in Sakhalin-1, its Russian partner is now offering dividends instead of equity oil. India, the world’s third-largest oil importer, is pushing for equity oil from Russia as sanctions-related difficulties have made it difficult to repatriate funds to India and energy security concerns.

“We want equity oil because we are unable to transfer dividends. After the Presidential decree, they took over the entire asset. Then, they said whoever wants their stake back needs to appeal to the Russian government. Post that, whether ONGC Videsh will get equity oil or dividend has still not been agreed upon. India has been asking for equity oil,” an Indian official said, requesting anonymity.

Rosneft’s proposal to offer dividend payments comes as Indian state-run energy firms face approximately $400 million in dividend payments from Vankorneft and Taas-Yuryakh stuck in Russia, as reported by Mint earlier. Recently, Russian deputy prime minister Denis Manturov discussed investment protection with the Indian government during his visit to the country. Indian state-owned firms, including ONGC Videsh, Bharat Petroresources Ltd, Indian Oil Corp, and Oil India Ltd, have invested $16 billion in Russia to date and earned around $9 billion.

Equity oil holds importance for India, given that the Opec-plus grouping recently announced yet another round of production cut, leading to a spike in oil prices. In such a scenario, having equity oil helps India navigate the uncertain energy markets.

A Rosneft spokesperson, in a detailed emailed response, said, “Since 26 April 2022, the former operator of the project, Exxon Neftegaz Ltd, began unilaterally, without consulting with the other participants, to gradually reduce production, and in May of last year, stopped the work of the project completely. In fact, the project was completely shut down, and more than 300 people of operational staff left their workplaces. At the same time, there was no reaction from Japanese and Indian participants of the project to the operator’s actions.”

Japan’s Sakhalin Oil and Gas Development Co. held 30% in the project, with Rosneft units holding the remaining 20%.

“In early October, in accordance with the presidential decree, a new Russian legal entity was created to manage the asset and resume full-scale operations in accordance with Russian law. At the same time, the opportunity was preserved for all existing shareholders to participate in the new project in proportion to their pre-existing interests in the Sakhalin-1 project. The only condition for continued participation was the formation of a liquidation fund for the project in the Russian Federation, previously organized by Exxon in Great Britain. The Indian partners have not fulfilled this condition for the time being,” the Rosneft spokesperson said.

In the 11 months to 28 February, Indian imports of Russian oil rose to $27 billion, second only to imports from Iraq, Mint reported on Friday, citing data from the Union ministry of commerce and industry.

“Due to the restrictions contained in ONGC’s charter, which does not allow it to carry out trading operations, and at ONGC’s request, the Indian partners of the project were given the opportunity to purchase all its products on the only condition - registration of the buyer in a jurisdiction that does not apply illegal sanctions against the Russian Federation,” the Rosneft spokesperson said.

ONGC Videsh wins $190-million arbitration awards against Sudan,ONGC Videsh wins $190-million arbitration awards against Sudan,"ONGC Videsh

ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) has won $190 million arbitration awards against Sudan in a long-running dispute over payments for oil and a pipeline, a media report said.

OVL, the overseas arm of the state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), has sent a demand notice to the Sudanese government seeking payments, the report said, adding the company hasn't gone to a court and is hoping to recover funds through diplomatic channels instead, The Economic Times cited sources as saying.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.

OVL started arbitration proceedings against the Sudanese government five years ago to recover its oil and pipeline construction dues, the report said.

The Indian firm owned a 25 percent stake in the joint venture that operated blocks 2A and 4 in Sudan. CNPC of China, Petronas of Malaysia and Sudapet of Sudan were the other stakeholders.

The Sudanese government took more than its share of the oil and didn’t pay for it. Payments had been accumulating since 2011, the report said. A few years ago, OVL exited the blocks and is engaged in arbitration, ET said.

OVL initiated two arbitration proceedings to recover its oil dues. Its claim for $90 million was upheld by a UK-based tribunal, sources told ET.

In the second case, in which OVL is seeing $300 million in claims, the award has not yet been finalised. The case will be heard in July, the report said.

In a third case, OVL is also seeking payment for a pipeline it built with Oil India in the northeastern African country over 15 years ago.

A Dubai-based tribunal upheld the Indian firm’s claim of $98 million, the report said. If the interest applicable to the principal amount is upheld, further hearings would be required, the report added.

Sudan has been in dire financial straits for years and OVL would find it difficult to enforce the award. It can go to court and seek to seize the Sudanese government's assets in different countries to collect the dues, as Cairn Energy did against India in the 2021 retrospective tax case, the report said.

OVL, however, seems to be relying on diplomatic channels for this, as of now.

OVL had in 2003 picked up a stake in the Greater Nile Oil Project consisting of blocks 1, 2 and 4 located about 800 km away from the Sudanese capital Khartoum. After South Sudan became an independent country in 2011, the blocks were split between South Sudan and Sudan, the report said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/companies-2/ongc-videsh-wins-190-million-arbitration-awards-against-sudan-10377401.html,"ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) has won $190 million arbitration awards against Sudan

Government ramps up efforts to resume Mozambique gas ops | Today News,Government ramps up efforts to resume Mozambique gas ops,"New Delhi: India is ramping up efforts to resume operations at a gas project in a terrorist-affected province of Mozambique where an ONGC Videsh-led Indian consortium has a 30% stake.

An Indian team is expected to visit the African nation soon to take stock of the project. “A team will soon visit the project (in Mozambique). We are looking at having a soft start to the operations,” said a person aware of the development.

The $20 billion ‘Offshore Area 1’ project has been under force majeure since April 2021 following attacks by Islamic State terrorists in the coastal town of Palma in Cabo Delgado province. “Considering the evolution of the security situation”, the TotalEnergies-operated Mozambique LNG had announced a withdrawal of all project personnel from the site.

Total E&P Mozambique Area 1 Limitada, a subsidiary of TotalEnergies, holds 26.5% in the plant.

Force majeure is a clause that allows removal of liability for natural disasters and catastrophes created by humans.

Three state-run companies hold a total of 30% stake in the project. ONGC Videsh holds 16%, while BPRL Ventures Mozambique BV, a subsidiary of BPCL, and Oil India Ltd hold 10% and 4% respectively.

TotalEnergies also has been making efforts to resume operations at the plant. Last month, the chairman and CEO of TotalEnergies, Patrick Pouyanne, visited Cabo Delgado to review the security and humanitarian situation. A company statement said he met with President Filipe Nyusi. Pouyanne entrusted Jean-Christophe Rufin, an expert in humanitarian action and human rights, with an independent mission to assess the humanitarian situation in Cabo Delgado.

According to another person in the know, efforts have been underway to resume operations for the past few months amid volatility in the global energy market and concerns over low availability of gas due to the Ukraine war. The person said: “It is one of the most prolific gas assets. Its just a three-day journey from there to India. So, once the supplies start, it would significantly and immediately add to the LNG availability in the country.”

Queries sent to the union ministry of petroleum and natural gas, ONGC Videsh, BPCL and Oil India remained unanswered till press time.

India has trying to widen its source base for its energy needs. The country currently depends on imports for as much as 85% of its oil needs and 55% of its natural gas demand. So far in FY23 (April-January), India has imported LNG worth $14.88 billion, 36.46% higher than $10.90 billion during the corresponding period of FY22.

The company already has a presence in both continents through stakes in projects in Mozambique, Brazil, and Venezuela among others.

""It's better to invest in bigger hot spots where you can get larger discoveries... Africa and Latin America still hold a lot of potential. Ghana is there, Suriname is there, all of the continental shelf. Brazil is also an interesting proposition,"" Gupta told reporters at the India Energy Week in Bengaluru.

Some of the hydrocarbon assets in Africa and Latin America hold large volumes, he said, adding his company is also looking for assets in southeast Asia and the Middle East.

OVL currently has a stake in 32 oil & gas projects in 15 countries, spanning projects in various phases, including exploration, development, production, and pipelines.

OVL's crude and gas output will decline from 12.5 million tonnes in 2021/22 due to lower production in Russia's Sakhalin 1 project, in which ONGC has a stake.

Output at Sakhalin 1 collapsed after the exit of its previous operator Exxon Mobil Corp due to Western sanctions against Russia after it invaded Ukraine in late February last year.

Gupta said current production at Sakhalin 1 is about 150,000 barrels per day and the production would rise to 200,000 bpd by June. ONGC's has a 20% stake in Sakhalin 1 project.

He said ONGC does not face any issues in raising funds, and has debt of $3-4 billion compared to net worth of more than $6 billion.

ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), has re-taken a 20 per cent stake in the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas fields in the far east region of Russia, an official said on Monday.

Russian President Vladimir Putin in October last year disbanded Exxon Neftegaz - a regional subsidiary of US super major ExxonMobil - as operator of the Sakhalin-1 and transferred the project and all of its assets and equipment to a new operator.

The other former foreign shareholders in the project - Japan's Sodeco consortium and ONGC Videsh - were asked to apply to the Russian government to regain their shareholdings in the project.

OVL applied and has been given the same shareholding as it had previously, the official said.

Production from Sakhalin-1 stopped in April 2022 after Exxon Neftegaz declared force majeure at the project in response to international sanctions imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.

Moscow assigned the Sakhalin-1 project and operatorship to a regional subsidiary of Russian oil producer Rosneft. Russia then asked foreign shareholders in the project - ExxonMobil, Sodeco and ONGC Videsh - to apply to reinstate their shareholdings in the project before mid-November.

The Sodeco consortium too has retained its stake but there is no clarity on what will happen to ExxonMobil's stake.

ExxonMobil had previously stated that it had fully exited Sakhalin-1 after the confiscation of assets and has no plans to operate the project.

Sakhalin-1 was producing 220,000 barrels per day of oil before the Ukraine war. Of this, OVL's share was 44,000 bpd or 2.2 million tonne per annum. However, western sanctions following the Russia-Ukraine war led to constraints in evacuating oil.

Production resumed in November and has reached 140,000-150,000 bpd, the official said adding the output is likely to restore to original levels by March end.

Sakhalin-1 is a large oil and gas field in far-east offshore Russia, spread over 1,140 square kilometers, which includes three offshore fields namely Chayvo, Odoptu and ArkutunDagi. OVL acquired 20 per cent stake in the project in July 2001.

Exxon Neftegas Limited (ENL) and Sodeco held a 30 per cent stake each. The remaining 20 per cent is held by Russia's Rosneft through its subsidiaries SMNG (11.5 per cent) and RN Astra (8.5 per cent).

Almost all of Sakhalin-1's oil production is shipped to international markets via the De-Kastri terminal, located in the Khabarovsk region on the Russian mainland, which is linked to Sakhalin-1 via a dedicated pipeline.

On October 7, 2022, the Russian President issued a decree, consequent to which the rights and obligations of the consortium under the Sakhalin-1 production sharing agreement (PSA) was transferred to a new company, Sakhalin-1 Limited Liability Company.

This new company has OVL and Rosneft with 20 per cent stake each and Sodeco with another 30 per cent, the official said adding Russia hasn't decided what it will do with the 20 per cent of ExxonMobil.

ONGC Videsh retakes 20% stake oil & gas fields at Sakhalin-I,ONGC Videsh retakes 20% stake oil & gas fields at Sakhalin-I,"State-run ONGC’s overseas arm, ONGC Videsh (OVL) has retaken its 20 per cent stake in the oil and gas fields at Sakhalin-I in Russia’s Far East. The production at the blocks resumed last year in December, sources said.

Production at Sakhalin-I stopped last year after its operator ENL, a subsidiary of Exxon Mobil, declared force majeure following international sanctions slapped on Russia.

“OVL has retaken its stake at Sakhalin. The production there also started last year in December. The supply from the fields do not seem to be a problem at present as Russian authorities say there are multiple options for insurance, including sovereign guarantees, and crude oil is being delivered through Russian hag vessels and the same thing would be applicable for Sakhalin,” an official source said.

Following the Ukraine conflict, the International Group of Protection & Indemnity (IG P&I), an international insurance club for all seaborne vessels especially crude oil vessels, stopped providing insurance due to which the vessels could not sail and subsequently production also came to a halt.

In October 2022, Russia issued a decree transferring the assets of Sakhalin to a Rosneft-owned entity under a holding structure and an option was given to all the foreign participatory interest holders, including Japan and India, to exercise their rights.

OVL had exercised its right to retake its share. It was also discussed during the official visit of External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar to Russia in November 2022. Before the sanctions, Sakhalin used to produce around 2 million tonnes (mt) of crude oil annually, of which OVL’s share was around 40,000 net barrels of oil and oil equivalent of gas.",https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/ongc-videsh-retakes-20-stake-oil-gas-fields-at-sakhalin-i/article66357591.ece,"State-run ONGC's overseas arm, ONGC Videsh (OVL) has retaken its 20 per

AKIPRESS.COM - ONGC Videsh Ltd Company, the overseas arm of India’s state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), has submitted an application to Russian authorities to retake a 20 per cent stake in the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas fields in the far east region of the country, Business Standard reported.

Russian President Vladimir Putin last month disbanded Exxon Neftegaz - a regional subsidiary of US super major ExxonMobil - as operator of the Sakhalin-1 and transferred the project and all of its assets and equipment to a new operator.

The other former foreign shareholders in the project - Japan's Sodeco consortium and India’s ONGC Videsh - have to apply to the Russian government to regain their shareholdings in the project.

""On October 7, 2022, the Russian President issued a decree and consequently the Government of the Russian Federation notified on October 12 its Resolution that the rights and obligations of the consortium under the Sakhalin-1 production sharing agreement (PSA) shall be transferred to a new company, Sakhalin-1 Limited Liability Company,"" ONGC said.

Moscow has assigned a 20 per cent stake in Sakhalin-1 and operatorship to a regional subsidiary of Russian oil producer Rosneft. Russia has asked foreign shareholders in the project - ExxonMobil, Sodeco and ONGC Videsh - to apply to reinstate their shareholdings.

""ONGC Videsh Board in its meeting held in October 2022, has approved submission of its consent to claim the company's right in Sakhalin-1,"" said ONGC.

While the Sodeco consortium has decided to retain its stake, ExxonMobil confirmed that it had fully exited Sakhalin-1 after the confiscation of assets and has no plans to operate the project.

Production from Sakhalin-1 stopped in May after Exxon Neftegaz declared force majeure at the project in response to international sanctions imposed on Russia following Russia-Ukraine conflict started in February.

Sakhalin-1 was producing 220,000 barrels per day of oil before the Ukraine war. Of this ONGC's share was 44,000 bpd or 2.2 million tonnes per annum. However, western sanctions following the Ukraine war led to constraints in evacuating oil. Sakhalin production has resumed under the new ownership of Rosneft and ONGC expects to get 1.5 million tonnes per annum in the fiscal year 2023.

The Sakhalin 1 project has turned out to be a money spinner for ONGC Videsh, and accounted for about a quarter of its proved reserves of 124.7 million tonnes in the year ended March 31, 2022.

Sources said ONGC would consider taking additional stake in the project if that makes ""commercial sense”. While the Indian company is keen to retain its stake in the project, Japan’s SODECO said it was still gathering information about the decree.

Last month, Russia had asked foreign shareholders in the project to apply for regaining their shares after Exxon Neftegaz, the Russian unit of Exxon Mobil Corp, declared force majeure on the project. The US giant, which had a 30 percent stake in Sakhalin-1, said it would not invest in the project to comply with sanctions imposed on Moscow.

Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree to set up a new operator for the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project. According to the decree, the Russian company would own the investors' rights, including the operator's rights of Exxon Neftegaz.

ONGC’s overseas investment arm, ONGC Videsh has 20 percent shares in the project while Japan's Sodeco consortium—which has also decided to retain its shares—has a 30 percent stake.

Russian oil producer Rosneft holds a 20 percent stake in the project through its subsidiaries.

BPCL's former Chairman Arun Kumar Singh to be the next head of ONGC,BPCL's former Chairman Arun Kumar Singh to be the next head of ONGC,"Oil refining and marketing company BPCL's former chairman Arun Kumar Singh is likely to be the new chairman of India's top oil and gas producer ONGC -- the first instance of a top PSU board-level position going to a person aged over 60.

A search-cum-selection committee, constituted by the oil ministry, zeroed in on Singh after interviewing six candidates on August 27, two sources aware of the matter said.

Singh retired after attaining the superannuation age last month and was already selected to head the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) before the August 27 interviews.

If his selection is approved, Singh will get three years as head of the cash-rich PSU (Public Sector Unit).

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is without a regular chairman and managing director since April 2021 and the senior most director on the board has been entrusted with the additional charge. Since then, the firm has seen a record three interim heads.

Sources said Singh became eligible for consideration for the job after the oil ministry relaxed age-related criteria.

Eligibility criteria for a board-level position at PSU provide for an internal candidate (applicant from within the PSU) should not be more than 58 years of age on the date of the vacancy. This eligibility for external candidates is the maximum age of 57 years on the date of the vacancy.

The ministry changed it to state that any candidate to be eligible for consideration should not be more than 60 years of age on the date of occurrence of the vacancy, according to the ministry's office memorandum sent to the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) on June 17. The vacancy arose on March 31, 2021.

This made Singh as well as Mukesh Kumar Surana, who superannuated as chairman and managing director of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) on April 30 this year, and Subhash Kumar, who retired as acting chairman of ONGC on December 31, 2021, eligible.

But strangely neither Surana nor Kumar figured in the shortlist of the candidates drawn by the search-cum-selection panel.

The relaxation in age limit also made all existing directors of ONGC eligible but again not all of them were called for interviews and neither was anyone from Oil India Ltd -- the other PSU oil explorer in the country.

Sources said questions were raised when the ministry first forwarded the selection made by the search committee for vetting by the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC), which makes all top appointments in the government.

The ministry was asked to provide for the advertisement that was issued to call for applicants, the vigilance clearance of the shortlisted candidate and the approval for raising the age limit.

It wasn't known how the ministry replied to those queries as no advertisement was issued.

The ministry did not reply to an email sent for comments.

Sources said vigilance clearance has now been sought for Singh and after that, his name would go to the ACC headed by Prime Minister for vetting.

Besides Singh, five candidates, including Engineers India Ltd chairman Vartika Shukla, had appeared for an interview before a search-cum-selection committee on August 27.

The panel had called nine candidates, including ONGC's then-acting chairman Alka Mittal and Indian Oil Corporation's (IOC) head S M Vaidya, for interviews.

Mittal and Vaidya chose not to appear for the interview, they said.

Others who appeared for the interview included ONGC directors Pankaj Kumar and Rajesh Kumar Srivastava. Srivastava is currently the acting chairman and managing director of ONGC.

Two of the three external candidates called for the interview appeared before the panel, they said.

The panel shortlisted nine candidates on the basis of the higher eligibility age limit proposed by the oil ministry, which brought most existing directors, who otherwise were ineligible to even apply, in the zone of consideration, they said.

Those shortlisted included Mittal and Srivastava, who is due to retire at the end of the year.

Strangely, the panel initially ignored ONGC's other three directors -- Director (Onshore) Anurag Sharma, Director (T&FS) O P Singh, and Director (Finance) Pomila Jaspal, as also anyone from the other state-owned oil and gas producer, Oil India Ltd (OIL).

However, a day before the interview, they were called to appear but all of them choose not to go, sources said.

Pankaj Kumar and Om Prakash Singh were the only directors from ONGC, who were eligible for consideration of the top post going by the existing rules.

The ministry also proposed an appointment for a period of three years from the date of joining instead of the present five-year term, according to the letter.

The three-member search-cum-selection committee was headed by the PESB chairman and composed of oil secretary and former Indian Oil chairman B Ashok (outside expert).

Most board-level appointments at public sector companies are done on the basis of recommendations of the Public Enterprise Selection Board (PESB) but the government headhunter in June last year did not find anyone suitable among nine candidates, including two serving IAS officers, to head ONGC.

""Keeping in view the strategic importance and vision for the company and its future, the board did not recommend any candidate and decided to constitute a search committee,"" the ministry letter said referring to PESB's interviews on June 5, 2021.

The panel was constituted after eight months of that recommendation on February 4.",https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/bpcl-s-former-chairman-arun-kumar-singh-to-be-the-next-head-of-ongc-122111700199_1.html,"Oil refining and marketing company BPCL's former chairman Arun Kumar Singh

ONGC Videsh set to retake its 20% stake in Russia's Sakhalin-1 oil fields,ONGC Videsh set to retake its 20% stake in Russia's Sakhalin-1 oil fields,"ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), has submitted an application to Russian authorities to retake a 20 per cent stake in the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas fields in the far east region of the country, the company said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin last month disbanded Exxon Neftegaz - a regional subsidiary of US super major ExxonMobil - as operator of the Sakhalin-1 and transferred the project and all of its assets and equipment to a new operator.

The other former foreign shareholders in the project - Japan's Sodeco consortium and ONGC Videsh - have to apply to the Russian government to regain their shareholdings in the project.

""ONGC Videsh Board in its meeting held on October 18, 2022, has approved submission of its consent to claim the company's right in Sakhalin-1,"" ONGC said in its notes to a stock exchange filing on July-September quarter earnings.

It ""expects retention of its interest in the project and is not expecting any major impact on its rights and obligations due to this transition,"" it said.

Moscow has assigned a 20 per cent stake in Sakhalin-1 and operatorship to a regional subsidiary of Russian oil producer Rosneft. Russia has asked foreign shareholders in the project - ExxonMobil, Sodeco and ONGC Videsh - to apply to reinstate their shareholdings in the project before mid-November.

While the Sodeco consortium has decided to retain its stake, ExxonMobil confirmed that it had fully exited Sakhalin-1 after the confiscation of assets and has no plans to operate the project.

Production from Sakhalin-1 stopped in May after Exxon Neftegaz declared force majeure at the project in response to international sanctions imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine in February.

""On October 7, 2022, the Russian President issued a decree and consequently the Government of the Russian Federation notified on October 12, 2022, its Resolution that the rights and obligations of the consortium under the Sakhalin-1 production sharing agreement (PSA) shall be transferred to a new company, Sakhalin-1 Limited Liability Company,"" ONGC said.

Sakhalin-1 was producing 2,20,000 barrels per day of oil before the Ukraine war. Of this OVL's share was 44,000 bpd or 2.2 million tonnes per annum. However, western sanctions following the Ukraine war led to constraints in evacuating oil.

At an investor call, company officials said Sakhalin production has resumed under the new ownership of Rosneft and ONGC expects to get 1.5 million tonnes per annum in FY23.

Sakhalin-1 is a large oil and gas field in far-east offshore Russia, spread over 1,140 square kilometres, which includes three offshore fields namely Chayvo, Odoptu and ArkutunDagi. OVL acquired a 20 per cent stake in the project in July 2001.

Exxon Neftegas Limited (ENL) and Sodeco held a 30 per cent stake each. The remaining 20 per cent is held by Russia's Rosneft through its subsidiaries SMNG (11.5 per cent) and RN Astra (8.5 per cent).

Russia has approved the participation of Japan’s Sakhalin Oil and Gas Development (SODECO) and India’s ONGC Videsh (OVL) in the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project, reported Interfax.

According to the corresponding instructions issued by Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and reviewed by the news agency, SODECO will own a 30% stake in the Russian Sakhalin 1 LLC, which is the new operator of the project, according to the production sharing agreement (PSA).

India’s Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) overseas arm ONGC Videsh will hold a 20% stake in the project under the terms of the PSA.

Created in October 2022 and registered in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, Sakhalin-1 LLC is managed by Russian firm Rosneft’s unit Sakhalinmorneftegaz-Shelf, with an 11.5% stake while JSC RN-Astra owns an 8.5% interest.

The remaining 80% stake was held by foreign participants, of which 30% was owned by Exxon Mobil, 30% by SODECO, and 20% by ONGC. These firms had a month to confirm their participation in the new project operator.

The Sakhalin-1 project comprises three oil and gas fields off the East Coast of Sakhalin Island in the Sea of Okhotsk. These include Odoptu, Chayvo, and Arkutun-Dagi, all located on the northeastern shelf.

ONGC applies to retain 20% stake in Russia's Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project,ONGC applies to retain 20% stake in Russia's Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project,"By Nidhi Verma

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's Oil and Natural Gas Corp has applied to the new Russian operator of the Sakhalin-1 to retain its stake in the oil and gas project in the Far East, a person familiar with the development said.

Russia has established a new entity, managed by a Rosneft subsidiary, that owns investor's rights in Sakhalin 1 after the exit of previous operator ExxonMobil. Moscow gave the state-run company the authority to decide whether foreign shareholders can retain their participation.

""Yes,"" said the person when asked if ONGC has applied to retain its stake in the project.

ONGC holds a 20% stake through its overseas investment arm ONGC Videsh.

ONGC Videsh and Rosneft did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Prior to formation of the new entity, Exxon and Sakhalin Oil and Gas Development Co (SODECO), a consortium of Japanese firms, held a 30% stake each in the project.

Russian oil major Rosneft through Sakhalinmorneftegaz-shelf and R N Astra owned the remaining 20% share.

Foreign shareholders were given a month to Nov. 12 to decide about their stakes.

Last week, the Japanese consortium also decided to stay in the project in a move welcomed by Tokyo.

Sakhalin-1 has turned out to be a money spinner for ONGC Videsh, and accounted for about a quarter of its proved reserves of 124.7 million tonnes in the year ended March 31, 2022.

Sakhalin-1 was producing 220,000 bpd before Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Its output collapsed however after Exxon refused to accept Russian insurance cover for the tankers as Western insurers pulled out due to the sanctions, according to industry sources.

Production from Sakhalin has appeared to have recovered after a change in its operator and industry sources have said the new Russian entity plans to restore oil output levels on Sakhalin-1 shortly.

The other former foreign shareholders in the project — Japan’s Sodeco consortium and ONGC Videsh — have to apply to the Russian government to regain their shareholdings in the project.

OVL is in the process of applying to regain the 20 per cent stake it held in the project, three sources aware of the matter said.

“We want to retain the shareholding and will do all that the local law requires us to do,” a source said.

Sakhalin-1 is OVL’s cash cow and without the project, the company will be a loss-making entity, another source said.

Production from Sakhalin-1 stopped in May after Exxon Neftegaz declared force majeure at the project in response to international sanctions imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine in February. Since then, OVL is facing cash issues, the source said.

OVL has stakes in 33 oil and gas assets in 15 countries, most of these being exploration assets. Sakhalin-1 is one of the oldest investments of OVL, where it has recovered all the money sunk in and was enjoying dividends.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, earlier this month, disbanded Exxon Neftigaz, the regional subsidiary of US supergiant ExxonMobil as operator of Sakhalin-1 and put the project and all its assets together. Assets and equipment were transferred to a new operator.



The other former foreign shareholders of the project – Japan’s Sodeco consortium and ONGC Videsh – must apply to the Russian government to regain their stake in the project. OVL is applying to regain its 20% stake in the project, three people familiar with the matter said.



Production of Sakhalin-1 was halted in May after Exxon Neftegaz declared force majeure on the project in response to international sanctions imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine in February.



OVL has stakes in 33 oil and gas properties in 15 countries, most of which are exploration properties.

The West Asian oil producer is the first country to have participated in India’s strategic petroleum reserves programme. In April-August, the UAE, which is a member country of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec), exported $8.36 billion of crude oil to India, or 10.8% of India’s total oil imports in value term, showed ministry of commerce and industry data.

India’s gas imports from UAE during April-August totalled $1.80 billion, or 21.8% of its gas imports. Opec accounts for around 85% of India’s total crude oil imports, and 40% of global production.

“We already have two blocks in the UAE, of which one is a producing block, and the other is an exploration block. We are looking to get into another producing block, and the stake is expected to be acquired by a consortium led by ONGC Videsh,"" said one of the two people cited above requesting anonymity.

As a part of India’s comprehensive strategic partnership with the UAE, OVL, IOCL, and Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd subsidiary BPRL have a 10% stake in the producing offshore Lower Zakum oil field. The agreement was inked in 2018 during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit.

Adnoc has also awarded exploration rights for the Abu Dhabi Onshore Block 1 to the BPCL-IOCL consortium. Considering that India is dependent on imports for 85% of its oil needs and 55% of natural gas demand, record high energy prices are a major concern. In such a scenario, picking up equity in oil and gas assets provides some relief.

When contacted, a BPCL spokesperson declined to comment. Queries emailed to the spokespersons of ONGC Videsh, IOCL, OIL, Adnoc and India’s ministry of petroleum and natural gas on Tuesday did not elicit any response till press time. Queries emailed to the UAE embassy in New Delhi on Wednesday night also remained unanswered.

Meanwhile, Adnoc is also looking to expand its presence in India through investments in refining and petrochemical projects besides stocking more crude oil in the country, the world’s third-largest energy consumer. Adnoc is also a stakeholder in the proposed refinery and petrochemicals project on India’s west coast. Adnoc has partnered with Reliance Industries Ltd to jointly build a petrochemicals facility in Ruwais, Abu Dhabi. OVL is the overseas arm of ONGC and has been investing in oil and gas assets to secure India’s energy needs. It owns participating interests (PI) in 33 oil and gas assets in 15 countries and contributed nearly 9.4% to India’s domestic oil and natural gas output in 2021-22.

Executives of all three companies met in Nairobi in July to discuss the plan, the people said on condition of anonymity.

Tullow Oil, an independent energy firm based in London but operating in Africa and South America, is planning to induct a strategic partner for its Project Oil Kenya. Tullow Oil’s proposed merger with Capricorn Energy Plc was recently shelved, with Capricorn choosing a combination with NewMed Energy Ltd Partnership.

Tullow is listed on London, Irish and Ghana stock exchanges and has 30 exploration and production licences across 11 countries.

“Tullow Oil Plc’s Kenyan oil project is an interesting opportunity that the Indian state-run consortium is actively pursuing. Diversifying energy supplies and securing equity energy is an important focus area for the Indian government,"" said one of the two people cited above, requesting anonymity.

With India dependent on imports for as much as 85% of its oil needs and 55% of its natural gas demand, the government has stepped up efforts to acquire equity energy at a time energy prices have become very unpredictable.

OVL is the overseas arm of Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) and has been investing in oil and gas assets. OVL owns a participating interest in 33 oil and gas assets in 15 countries and has produced around 9.4% of oil and natural gas of India’s domestic production in FY22.

An OVL spokesperson, in an emailed response, said, “As per company policy, we do not respond to market speculations."" Queries emailed to the spokespersons of Tullow Oil, and Indian Oil Corp. remained unanswered till press time.

A sharp output cut by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) amid record high prices of fuels in India has raised concerns among Indian policy planners, with the world’s third-largest oil consumer, particularly at a disadvantage; as any increase in global prices can affect the country’s import bill, stoke inflation and widen its trade deficit.

“In December 2021, as per the licence extension obligations provided by the government of Kenya in September 2020, the Project Oil Kenya JV Partners submitted a field development plan for the 10BB and 13T licences, including the additional exploration and appraisal (E&A) opportunities within the 10BB and 13T licences. The E&A plan for 10BA was also submitted,"" according to the information available on Tullow Oil website.

India’s energy security efforts have been gaining traction. A case in point is OVL looking to invest around $1 billion in a Brazilian offshore hydrocarbon block with Brazil’s state-run Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) as the operator and raise its stake in the block, as reported by Mint earlier. India has been trying to diversify its energy supplies and access equity oil, with Indian Oil Corp. recently signing separate long-term contracts to procure crude oil from Colombia’s state-run Ecopetrol SA and Petrobras, respectively. Also, India is in talks with Angola and Algeria to procure liquefied natural gas (LNG) on long-term contracts.

OVL plans $1 bn investment in offshore Petrobras block | Mint,OVL plans $1 bn investment in offshore Petrobras block,"State-run ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) is looking to invest around $1 billion in a Brazilian offshore hydrocarbon block and also raise its stake, a person aware of the development said, in the latest Indian effort to strengthen energy security.

Brazil’s state-run Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) operates the BM Seal-4 block with a 75% participating interest, while OVL holds the rest. It saw a major gas discovery in 2019 and is expected to start production after 2026. OVL’s stake in the block is expected to go up after the investment.

OVL’s decision to invest follows the declaration of commerciality (DoC) for the BM Seal-4 block, with the final investment decision (FID) to be taken shortly. The block lies in the Sergipe Alagoas Offshore Basin in a 320 sq. km area.

“Energy diversification is an important agenda before the Indian government with investments planned in Brazil,” the person cited above said on the condition of anonymity.

The investment plan comes against the backdrop of a growing energy partnership between India and Brazil. India has been trying to diversify its energy supplies and access equity oil and gas from Brazil, which is currently the seventh largest global crude oil producer and exporter. India’s playbook also involves using Brazil as a beachhead to firm up partnerships with other Latin American countries. The efforts have gained traction, with Indian Oil Corp. recently signing a long-term contract to procure crude oil from Colombia’s state-run Ecopetrol SA.

With India dependent on imports for as much as 85% of its oil needs and 55% of its natural gas demand, the country’s policy planners have been trying to acquire equity energy at a time energy prices have become very unpredictable in the wake of the Ukraine war. A consortium of OVL, Indian Oil Corp. (IOC) and Oil India Ltd is also looking to invest jointly in the massive Vostok project of Russia’s Rosneft. India has also been looking to invest in Novatek’s Arctic LNG-2 project as part of its energy security efforts.

Queries emailed to the spokespeople for OVL, ONGC, and India’s ministry of petroleum and natural gas on 30 September remained unanswered till press time.

A Petrobras spokesperson, in an emailed response, said, “Petrobras informs that there is no transaction concerning BM Seal-4.”

The proposed investment in Brazil comes against the backdrop of IOC inking a long-term supply contract with Petrobras. Also, state-run BPCL’s subsidiary Bharat PetroResources Ltd (BPRL) will invest $1.6 billion to develop the BM-Seal-11 project in Brazil. India’s cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA) in July approved this additional investment in the project, which is expected to see production from 2026-27, wherein BPRL has 40% PI, and Petrobras, with 60% participating interest, is the operator.

“Most people and even experts have not registered that Brazil is an important player in oil. Today, we are the seventh largest producer and seventh largest exporter of oil, and we will be the fifth largest producer and exporter soon. However, India is one of the first countries to accept the idea that Brazil is a major player in oil. Since Brazil is a new player in this industry, it is important that we have as close a relationship as possible with India, which is a major consumer nation,” Brazil’s ambassador to India, Andre Aranha de Lago, said in a recent interview.

The proposed investment in the Petrobras block by OVL also comes at a time India has been trying to secure LNG globally after a contract with GAIL (India) Ltd was reneged on by Gazprom’s former subsidiary, Gazprom Marketing and Trading Singapore. India has reached out to the US, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq at a government-to-government level to secure additional LNG cargoes at affordable prices, as reported by Mint earlier.

India’s natural gas consumption has been on an upswing with a focus on developing a gas-based economy, with the country consuming 163.06 million standard cu. m per day (mscmd) in FY22. Gas comprises 6.2% of India’s primary energy mix, far behind the global average of 24%. The government plans to increase this share to 15% by 2030. With India being the world’s fourth-largest LNG importer, Indian firms have inked long-term LNG contracts totalling 22 million tonnes per annum (mtpa). India’s gas demand is expected to be driven by the fertilizer, power, city gas distribution, and steel sectors. India’s import and production of natural gas in 2021-22 resulted in supplies of 64.8 billion cu m in the country. India produced 34,024 mscm of gas in 2021-22.",https://www.livemint.com/industry/energy/ovl-plans-1-bn-investment-in-offshore-petrobras-block-11664996472983.html,"State-run ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) is looking to invest around $1 billion in a

Located at water depths ranging from 20m to 90m within the 3,500km² Farsi offshore block, the Farzad gas and condensate field straddles the Iran-Saudi Arabia maritime border.

According to the estimates, the field holds approximately 23 trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves and gas condensates of 5,000 barrels per billion cubic feet.

In 2002, the Indian consortium comprising OVL, the overseas investment arm of India’s state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), the Indian Oil Corporation, and Oil India secured an exploration service contract for the Farsi block.

Later in 2008, the consortium discovered the gas field in the Farsi offshore block.

In 2009, a consortium announced an approximately $3bn investment plan to develop Farzad-B.

Following the submission of a master development plan (MDP) to bring the discovery into production in April 2011, negotiations were stalled as a result of international sanctions imposed on Iran over its nuclear plans.

Although negotiations restarted in 2015, technical studies could not be concluded due to sanctions on Iran in November 2018, ending deliberations between the Indian consortium and Iran.

In 2020, the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) decided to award the contract to a local firm to develop the field. A development contract was subsequently signed with Iranian company Petropars.

Through the contract, Petropars will produce 28 million cubic metres of sour gas per day over five years.

Officials were cited by the PTI as saying that the exploration contract allowed OVL and its partners to participate in the offshore field development project.

Citing the exploration service contract, the Indian consortium has been asked by Iran to exercise its rights to participate in the field development contract with a minimum stake of 30%. This option period is valid for 90 days

Mumbai: Lenders of VOVL , the oil and gas exploration company owned by Venugopal Dhoot , received binding bids from ONGC Videsh and Prudent Asset Reconstruction Company late last week, people aware of the development told ET.They also received two separate non-binding offers from Brazilian energy companies, Eneva SA and Petro Rio SA, the people said.Lenders led by the State Bank of India are hoping to recover at least one-third of loans or ₹9,000 crore-₹10,000 crore given to VOVL, earlier known as Videocon Oil Ventures The resolution professional Pravin Navandar has admitted ₹30,640 crore claims from financial creditors. VOVL has about ₹1,800 crore-₹2,000 crore as cash balance.It is among the list of companies that the National Asset Reconstruction Co, the government-owned bad bank, plans to acquire from lenders. So far, NARCL has not made any firm offer.Navandar declined to comment and ONGC did not respond to ET's request for comments.Although VOVL was admitted for insolvency resolution in November 2019, the sale process has been prolonged, with the resolution professional (RP) inviting firm bids twice in the last three years in the hope of wider participation.In October 2020, the RP received an expression of interest (EoI) from Vedanta and four separate EoIs from Brazilian companies - Petro SA, GeoPark Brasil, Eneva SA and Wintershall Dea. This followed firm bids from Petro SA and Eneva SA.Around the same time, lenders decided to restart the process in an attempt to widen the participation from Indian companies and instructed the RP not to open the resolution plans from the two Brazilian companies.The move to attract more applicants was to avert a fiasco similar to Videocon Industries, where the bankruptcy court frowned at lenders for accepting a bid closer to liquidation value.VOVL lenders approached ONGC's top management, requesting them to participate in the resolution process, as reported by ET on December 7, 2021. Lenders believed that participation by the state-owned company would bring credibility to the process.Subsequently, the RP received EoIs from over a dozen companies. These included Vedanta, ONGC Videsh, Singapore-based Saiml Pte Ltd, Petro Rio SA and Eneva SA, Eight Capital, Dubai-based Citax Holding, Zinnia Fund, Murphy Worldwide, CFM ARC and Prudent ARC , as reported by ET on December 21.While approving the resolution plan in June 2021, NCLT had questioned how lenders agreed to sell Videocon Industries to billionaire Anil Agarwal-promoted Twin Star Technologies at a price equating to a recovery of 4.15% of the total claims. The NCLAT, on July 19, 2021, stayed the sale of Videocon and its 12 companies following an appeal by Bank of Maharashtra on the distribution of proceeds.",https://m.economictimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/ongc-videsh-prudent-arc-make-binding-offers-for-venugopal-dhoots-vovl/articleshow/93991478.cms,"Lenders led by the State Bank of India are hoping to recover at least

The other prominent name that gave the interview a miss despite being invited was CMD of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) SM Vaidya. On the other hand, those who did appear for the interview included Rajesh Kumar Srivastava, who has now been given additional charge as CMD. This keeps him in the race for the post of regular CMD of ONGC. Others who appeared for the interview included Engineers India Ltd (EIL) Chairperson Vartika Shukla, Arun Kumar Singh of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and one internal candidate from ONGC apart from Rajesh Srivastava, the Director (Offshore) Pankaj Kumar.

It may be recalled that Srivastava is also due to retire at the end of December and, hence, the process has begun also for the selection of the new Director, Exploration.

The interview will be held on 9 September at the CGO Complex, New Delhi. The candidates have permission to participate online too if they so prefer.

A senior official at Kenya’s ministry of petroleum and mines tweeted earlier this week that ministry officials had met the Indian High Commissioner to Kenya along with representatives of ONGC Videsh, the overseas investment arm of Oil and Natural Gas Corp, and Indian Oil Corporation Limited.

“The meeting was positive and the parties agreed to hold further discussions in the coming weeks,” Africa-focused Tullow said in a tweet about the meeting, adding that the talks had been hosted by the ministry of petroleum and mines.

Africa-focused Tullow said earlier in July it was confident it could make substantial progress to find an investor for its onshore oil project in the East African country in the second half of the year.

India’s Yes Bank to raise $1.1bn via stake sale

India’s Yes Bank said on Friday it will sell up to 10 percent stake to US private equity firms Carlyle Group Inc. and Advent International for $1.1 billion.

Yes Bank will raise the funds through a combination of about $640 million in shares and about $475 million in share warrants, the private lender said in a statement.

Yes Bank will offer 3.69 billion shares to affiliates of Carlyle Group and Advent for 13.78 Indian rupees ($0.1737) apiece.

The company will also issue 2.56 billion share warrants at a price of 14.82 Indian rupees per warrant to both investors.

Earlier this month, Yes Bank said it would seek to raise about $1 billion in this financial year as it exits a reconstruction plan after two years.

The company also selected an asset reconstruction firm belonging to private equity firm JC Flowers as the base bidder for the sale of bad loans worth 480 billion Indian rupees.

Ola and Uber deny report of merger talks

Uber Technologies Inc. and its Indian rival Ola on Friday denied a media report that the ride-hailing firms were in talks for a merger.

An Economic Times report said that Ola CEO Bhavish Aggarwal had met top Uber executives in San Francisco, US, citing two sources.

“That report is inaccurate. We are not, nor have we been, in merger talks with Ola,” Uber said in a statement.

Ola’s Aggarwal tweeted, “Absolute rubbish. We’re very profitable and growing well. If some other companies want to exit their business from India they are welcome to! We will never merge.”

"India's OVL loses operating rights in Iran's Farzad-B gas field: Know why 
here!","India's OVL loses operating rights in Iran's Farzad-B gas field: Know why 
here!","The state-owned ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) has lost its development and operating rights in Iran's Farzad-B giant gas field to Iranian Petropars Group. The OVL, which is the overseas investment arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), owns 40 percent participating interest (PI) in the block.

Farzad-B gas field's discovery An ONGC-led consortium had first discovered the giant gas field in the Farsi offshore exploration block in 2008. It was later named Farzad-B. The other partners in its consortium included Indian Oil Corporation and Oil India. The ONGC consortium had offered to put in investment up to USD 11 billion for the development of the gas field. Key Highlights •The Indian consortium had so far invested around USD 400 million in the gas block. •However, issues in negotiations between OVL and Iranian authorities as well as US sanctions led to the failure of multiple negotiations between the company and Iranian regulators to finalise a development plan. •Ultimately, India lost the operating rights of the gas field after Iran awarded the contract to develop the giant gas field to a local company. •The National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) signed a contract worth $1.78 billion with Petropars Group for the development of Farzad B Gas Field in the Persian Gulf. •The deal was signed in Tehran on May 17, 2021 in the presence of the Iranian Minister of Petroleum Bijan Zangeneh. •The contract envisages daily production of about 28 million cubic meters of sour gas in the next five years.

Farzad-B gas field: Significance •The Farzad-B gas field comprises 23 trillion cubic feet of in-place gas reserves, out of which 60 percent is estimated to be recoverable. •The gas field also holds gas condensates of about 5,000 barrels per billion cubic feet of gas. •The 3,500 sqkm Farsi block sits in a water depth of 20-90 metres on the Iranian side of the Persian Gulf. Why has OVL lost its operating rights in the Farzad-B gas field? Everything you need to know- Full Timeline •OVL, which had 40 percent operatorship interest, had signed the Exploration Service Contract (ESC) for the gas block on December 25, 2002. The other partners of OVL- Indian Oil Corp (IOC) holds 40 percent Participating Interest, while Oil India holds the remaining 20 percent Participating Interest. •The OVL had first discovered gas in the block, which was declared commercially viable by NIOC on August 18, 2008. The exploration phase expired on June 24, 2009. •The OVL had submitted a Master Development Plan (MDP) of Farzad-B gas field in April 2011 to Iranian Offshore Oil Company (IOOC), the then designated authority by NIOC for the development of the gas field. •Though a Development Service Contract (DSC) was negotiated till November 2012, but it could not be finalized due to difficult terms and international sanctions on Iran. •The negotiations began again with the Iranian authorities in April 2015 under a new Iran Petroleum Contract (IPC). Pars Oil and Gas Company (POGC) was introduced as NIOC's representative for negotiations this time. •In April 2016, the two sides negotiated to develop the Farzad-B gas field under an integrated contract. The contract covered both upstream and downstream as well as monetization and marketing of the processed gas. The negotiations though remained inconclusive. •The NIOC informed OVL on October 18, 2020 of its intention to award the contract for Farzad-B's development with an Iranian company, after sitting over OVL's proposal for years.",https://www.jagranjosh.com/current-affairs/indias-ovl-loses-operating-rights-in-irans-farzadb-gas-field-know-why-here-1621406179-1,"The OVL owns 40 percent participating interest (PI) in the block in which

OVL owns 40 per cent participating interest (PI) in the block in which gas discovery was first made by a consortium led by ONGC.

Indian Oil Corporation too owns 40 per cent of PI, with Oil India holding the remaining 20 per cent PI in the block. Issues in negotiations between OVL and Iranian authorities as well as US sanctions led to the failure of multiple negotiations between the company and Iranian regulators to finalise a development plan.

“The National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) has signed a contract worth $1.78 billion with Petropars Group for the development of Farzad-B Gas Field in the Persian Gulf,” the Iranian Oil Ministry’s official news service Shana reported.

The gas field, which has in-place reserves of about 651 billion cubic metres of gas reserves, is expected to record about 28 million metric standard cubic meters per day (MMSCMD) of production within five years. India’s total gas consumption in FY21 was about 166 MMSCMD.

Sources told The Indian Express that Tehran had told India in January 2020 that it would develop the Farzad-B Gas field on its own. It had, however, kept the door open for India to join later.

An official, privy to the discussions, said that “In January 2020, we were informed that in the immediate future, Iran would develop the field on its own and would like to involve India appropriately at a later stage.”

Experts noted that a loss of operating rights was key as it would mean that ONGC was largely out of the driver’s seat for an investment in which it was among the largest stakeholders.

“Typically when a large player like ONGC has a major participating interest, it is likely that they also get operating rights which allows then to enhance or cut production as required and coordinate their capital expenditure,” said an expert who did not wish to be quoted noting that while ONGC would still be consulted as a key stakeholder, the operations would be controlled by the Petropars group. The expert noted that an operator separate from the largest stakeholder could also lead to a lack of transparency and inefficiencies in procurement.

OVL had signed the exploration service contract for the block in 2002 and the block was deemed commercially viable in 2008 after a discovery of gas was made by a consortium of companies led by OVL. Differences between regulators and OVL on terms of development and international sanctions on Iran led to a development plan submitted by OVL in 2011 not being approved.

Negotiations were restarted with Iranian regulators in 2015, under a new integrated contract covering upstream and downstream including monetisation/ marketing of the processed gas but negotiation remained inconclusive.

Report: India's ONGC Sells Russia's Sokol Oil to Indian Refiners,Report: India's ONGC Sells Russia's Sokol Oil to Indian Refiners,"India's ONGC Videsh Ltd has sold at least one cargo of Russian Sokol oil to India refiners Hindustan Petroleum Corp and Bharat Petroleum Corp after failing to draw interest in a tender earlier this month, sources familiar with the matter said.

Indian companies are snapping up Russian oil as it is available at a deep discounts after some companies and countries shunned purchases from Moscow due to sanctions against Russia for its Ukraine invasion. Read full story

India, the world's third-biggest oil consumer and importer, has not banned Russian oil imports.

ONGC Videsh, the overseas investment arm of Oil and Natural Gas Corp, has a stake in Russia's Sakhalin-1 project and sells its share of the oil from the project through tenders.

In the tender earlier in March, ONGC Videsh did not get any bids for the Sokol crude oil cargo for May loading.

The sources said HPCL and BPCL had been able to offer a discounted price for the cargo. This marks the first purchase of Sokol crude by HPCL. BPCL had previously purchased the grade in 2016.

The two refiners will pay ONGC in rupees, the sources added.

One of the sources said ONGC Videsh will look at selling more cargos to Indian refiners if there is no interest from overseas buyers.

ONGC Videsh, HPCL, and BPCL did not respond to Reuters' emails seeking comment.

Western sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine have hit Russian oil sales, making it possible for Indian and Chinese refiners to buy Russian Urals crude at a deep discount.

India has called for an end to violence in Ukraine but refrained from outright condemnation of Russia, with which it has long-standing political and security ties.

Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his troops into Ukraine on what he calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Ukraine and the West say Putin launched an unprovoked war of aggression.

Sudan owes ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) a total of USD 560 million in unpaid oil dues and cost of pipeline built by the Indian firm built for the African nation, the government told Parliament on Monday. OVL, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation ( ONGC ), had a 25 per cent stake in Block 2A&4 in Sudan. Sudan had since 2011 not paid OVL and partners for oil it bought from the block.""The amount due to OVL on account of over lifting of crude oil under the Exploration and Production Sharing Agreement (EPSA) is USD 339.75 million and under sale and purchase agreement (SPA) is USD 90.94 million, which amounts to USD 430.69 million in total,"" Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas Rameswar Teli said in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha.OVL had also not been paid for the 741-km-long pipeline it built from Khartoum to Port Sudan.The company initiated arbitration proceedings against the Government of Sudan to recover the dues and has terminated the Exploration and Production Sharing Agreement (EPSA).""Under Sovereign Guarantee- Pipeline Contract Agreement (SG-PCA) arbitration between OVL and Sudan Government, OVL has raised a demand of USD 98.94 million principal amount along with interest/damages for unpaid and delayed installments from the Sudan government,"" he said.The African nation has admitted before the arbitration tribunal that it owes about USD 131 million to OVL in pipeline dues.""The Sudan government, in its statement of defence, has admitted about the unpaid instalments amounting USD 98.94 million and interest of USD 31.0 million payable on unpaid and delayed installments,"" the minister said.The arbitration tribunal at the International Court of Justice in Hague is hearing the matter.""The outcome of the arbitrations are contingent on the Hon'ble Permanent Court of Arbitration, based outside India,"" he said.OVL had in 2003 acquired 25 per cent interest in the Greater Nile Oil Project in Sudan. China's CNPC holds a 40 per cent stake in the project, while Malaysia's Petronas has 30 per cent and Sudapet of Sudan owns the remaining 5 per cent.GNOP consisted of the upstream assets of on-land Blocks 1, 2 and 4 spread over 49,500 sq km in the Muglad Basin, located about 780 km South-West of the capital city of Khartoum in Sudan.The crude oil produced from the oil field of GNOP is transported through a 1,504-km pipeline to Port Sudan at the Red Sea.Upon the secession of South Sudan from Sudan in July 2011, the contract areas of Blocks 1, 2 and 4 which straddle between Sudan and South Sudan was split with a major share of production and reserves are now situated in South Sudan.Post-secession, as the Government of Sudan's share of total production from Sudan was not sufficient to meet the requirements of local refineries, foreign firms were asked to sell their share of crude oil to it.However, the payment of dues on account of crude oil purchased by the Government of Sudan has not been received.OVL had along with state-owned Oil India Ltd constructed and financed a 741-km multi-product pipeline from the Khartoum refinery to Port Sudan for USD 194 million.OVL's share of the project cost was 90 per cent, while the rest was borne by OIL.The pipeline was handed over to the government of Sudan in October 2005. The lump-sum price, together with lease rent was required to be paid to OVL in 18 equal half-yearly installments effective from December 2005.The project cost and rental totalled USD 254 million, which equated to 18 half-yearly installments of USD 14.135 million each starting from December 30, 2005. The company got a total of 11 installments (USD 155.48 million) till December 2010 and the balance seven installments amounting to USD 98.94 million remained outstanding.The remaining seven installments due from June 30, 2011, to June 30, 2014, are yet to be released.OVL, whose share of investment in the project was USD 158.01 million, has been following up for the realisation of USD 98.94 million from the government of Sudan at various levels but hasn't succeeded so far.This prompted the company to drag Sudan to arbitration.Sudan had denied ONGC and partners an extension of licence to operate block 2B after the initial contract expired in November 2016.",https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/oil-and-lubes/sudan-owes-ongc-videsh-560-mn-in-unpaid-dues-govt/88125119,"ONGC Videsh Ltd: ""The Sudan government, in its statement of defence, has

New Delhi: ONGC Videsh Ltd , the overseas investment arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), on Thursday said it has spud the first well in an offshore block in Bangladesh , marking the start of an exploration campaign to find oil and gas. ""Well Kanchan#1 in Block SS04, Bangladesh was spud on September 29 at Maheshkhali Island. This exploratory well is planned to be drilled to a depth of 4,200 meters and will be targeting two prospective formations,"" the company said in a statement.This well will be followed by drilling at two more exploratory locations. OVL , in consortium with Oil India Ltd (OIL), was awarded two shallow offshore Blocks SS-04 and SS-09 in Bangladesh during the Bid Round of 2012.The production sharing contract ( PSC ) was signed between OVL, OIL and Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration & Production Company Limited ( BAPEX ) in February 2014.OVL with participating interest (PI) of 45 per cent is the operator. OIL has 45 per cent interest, and BAPEX holds the remaining 10 per cent.BAPEX is being carried equally by ONGC Videsh and OIL up to the commercial discovery stage.""All pre-drilling activities were completed with the rig being on location in late 2019 and with spudding scheduled for March 2020.

New Delhi: ONGC Videsh Ltd , the overseas arm of Oil and Natural Gas Corp ONGC ), has for the seventh time sought an extension to explore a Vietnamese oil block in the contested waters of the South China Sea. Officials said OVL has applied for a two-year extension to explore Block-128, the licence for which was valid till June 15, 2021.While India wants to maintain its strategic interest in the South China Sea, Vietnam wants an Indian firm to counter China's interventions in the contested waters.OVL had signed a production sharing contract (PSC) with PetroVietnam for deepwater exploratory Block- 128 having an area of 7,058 square kilometers in Offshore PhuKhanh Basin, Vietnam in May 2006. An investment licence was issued to it on June 16, 2006, thereby giving effect to the PSC.Officials said the company continues to explore for oil and gas in the block that lies in a water depth of 200-2,000 meters. No discovery has yet been made on the block, they said.OVL during the exploration period acquired 3D seismic data, reprocessed 2D seismic data and carried out G&G studies.But it is yet to drill the one well it had committed as part of the minimum work programme, they said adding further G&G studies are being carried out.Vietnam on October 29, 2019, had granted a two-year extension from June 16, 2019 to June 15, 2021 and a request for a further two years of extension of Exploration Phase-1 of the PSC was made on March 12 this year.""We are hoping they will agree to extend the PSC till June 15, 2023,"" an official said adding the Vietnamese national oil company PetroVietnam has agreed to share some of the technical data pertaining to the nearby area of Block 128 for Petroleum System Modelling and other related studies for better geological understanding.Another official said the company had a couple of years ago drilled a well on the block but it could not reach the target depth and so it now has to drill the well all over again.""If we don't drill, we are liable to pay penalties,"" he said.The company has not found any hydrocarbon in the block but is continuing to stay invested to maintain India's strategic interest.OVL first took a two-year extension of the exploration period till June 2014 and then another one year. A third extension was granted on May 28, 2015, and a fourth in 2016. It got the fifth extension for two years in 2017.The block lies in the part of the South China Sea over which China claims sovereignty. In 2011, Beijing had warned OVL that its exploration activities off the Vietnam coast were illegal and violated China's sovereignty, but the company continued exploring for oil and gas.OVL made a foray into Vietnam as early as 1988 when it bagged the exploration licence for Block 6.1.OVL owns a 45 per cent stake in Block 6.01 and its share of condensate and oil equivalent gas production from the block was 1.330 million tonnes during 2020-21 fiscal.The 955 sq km Block 06.1 located in Nam Con Son basin has two producing fields -- Lan Tay and Lan Rosneft -- and has a 35 per cent stake while the remaining 20 per cent is with PetroVietnam.The firm in 2006 got two exploration blocks -- Block 127 and Block 128. While Block 127 was relinquished due to poor prospects, the other block was retained.The first extension for Block 128 followed China putting the area under Block 128 for global bidding.China claims sovereignty over most of the South China Sea where the two blocks are located and had warned the Indian arm from drilling in the region.",https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/oil-and-gas/ovl-seeks-another-2-yr-extension-for-exploring-vietnamese-oil-block-in-south-china-sea/86445432,"New Delhi: ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of Oil and Natural Gas Corp

Three years after its much-acclaimed maiden entry into Israeli water that was symbolic of New Delhi's growing closeness with Tel Aviv, an ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL)-led Indian consortium has relinquished the offshore oil block due to ""very poor"" hydrocarbon prospectivity. The consortium of OVL IOC ), Oil India Ltd and Bharat Petro Resources Ltd (BRPL) has relinquished offshore Block-32, two officials with the partners said.When the Indian consortium in late 2017 won the Israeli energy ministry's nod to bid for the block, it was hailed as New Delhi's growing closeness with Tel Aviv amid a widening chasm with Iran over its recalcitrance in awarding the Farzad-B gas field development rights to the OVL-led group.The nod for the Offshore Block-32 by the Ministry of National Infrastructure, Energy and Water Resources came ahead of the then Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to India in January 2018.Before that oil and gas was not part of the bilateral engagements between the two sides.The block was awarded to the four partners in the first Israel Offshore Bid Round 2016 and the Petroleum License was signed on March 27, 2018, the officials said, adding the four partners held 25 per cent apiece in the block whose petroleum license was valid up to March 26, 2021.OVL, the overseas investment arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), was the operator through Indus East Mediterranean Exploration Ltd (IEMEL).The officials said the Indian partners carried out an assessment of hydrocarbon prospectivity based on the available 2D and 3D seismic data and submitted a report to the Israeli Petroleum Commissioner on March 28, 2019.The report along with prospectivity analysis of the block was submitted to the regulator,"" an official said. ""Due to very poor hydrocarbon prospectivity, the consortium decided to relinquish the block and the notice of relinquishment was issued to the Petroleum Commissioner, Israel. The Petroleum Commissioner, Israel has approved the relinquishment.""Block-32 has an area of 356.98 square kilometres and was located offshore Israel with water depth ranging between 1,500-1,800 meters.As per the bid conditions, the partners were supposed to carry out reprocessing and interpretation of available seismic data.The seismic and other G&G data was sourced from Israeli authorities.OVL had discovered a giant Farzad-B gas field in the Persian Gulf, but Iran has dragged its feet on giving its development rights to the Indian consortium.",https://m.economictimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/ongc-videsh-ltd-partners-relinquish-israeli-oil-block/articleshow/85971965.cms,"When the Indian consortium in late 2017 won the Israeli energy ministry's

New Delhi: ONGC Videsh Ltd, India's flagship overseas oil and gas firm, and the nation's largest refiner Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) on Friday signed agreements with Russia's Gazprom for cooperation in the hydrocarbon sector. Indian oil and gas companies are looking to acquire stakes in prolific oil and gas areas in Russia as part of a larger strategy to acquire equity oil and gas overseas that could offset the country's huge 85 per cent dependence on imports for meeting energy needs. OVL , the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), inked MoUs on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum at Vladivostok , the company tweeted.IOC also signed a similar MoU for cooperation in the hydrocarbon sector.Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri is leading an official and business delegation to Russia to participate in the 6th Eastern Economic Forum (EEF) Summit in Vladivostok.Russia is the largest investment destination for the Indian oil and gas companies. Indian public sector companies have made investments of about USD 16 billion in Russia, including in the Far East and East Siberia, in oil and gas assets such as Sakhalin-1, Vankor and Taas-Yuryakh.Russia is also the largest investor in India's oil and gas sector.""Biggest Indian oil multinational @ongcvideshltd inks MoU with #Russian oil major @GazpromEN to cooperate in #Hydrocarbon sector, on sidelines of #EEF2021 at Vladivostok in presence of @PetroleumMin @HardeepSPuri, CEO @gazpromneft Alexander #Dyukov Indian ambassador,"" OVL tweeted.Puri also tweeted about the agreements.""In a meeting with the CEO of #Gazpromneft Mr. Alexander #Dyukov welcomed two MoUs of Cooperation signed with @IndianOilcl and @ongcvideshltd which demonstrate our companies' abiding interest in engagement with Russian energy companies,"" he said.The minister also met officials of Russian giants Sibur and Novatek.""Strengthening cooperation in Petrochemical sector.

VLADIVOSTOK: India's Oil and Natural Gas Corp is evaluating the purchase of stake in Russia's massive Vostok Oil project , a company official said on Thursday, as the two countries seek to deepen their economic ties in the energy sector.Vostok is one of Russia's biggest oil projects, comparable in size with the exploration of West Siberia in the 1970s or the U.S. Bakken oil province over the past decade.""We are still in the evaluation stage ... We are looking at it ( Vostok Oil ), it is a very large complex project,"" A.K, Gupta, managing director of ONGC Videsh Ltd , the overseas investment arm of ONGC , told Reuters.He did not give any further details on the deal.Russian oil major Rosneft is in talks with several players about participation in Vostok, which according to initial estimates could require the investment of more than 10 trillion roubles ($137 billion).Global commodities trader Trafigura has a 10% stake in Vostok Oil and a consortium of traders Vitol and Mercantile & Maritime have shown interest in taking a 5% stake in the project.Indian Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri, who is in Russia for an economic forum, met Russian Energy Minister Nikolai Shulginov and Rosneft chief Igor Sechin. The forum in the Russian Pacific port of Vladivostok was also attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin.""Look forward to further strengthening strategic cooperation across the entire value chain of the energy sector with Russia,"" the Indian minister said on Twitter after meeting Shulginov.Gupta said Russia was a ""preferred destination"" for energy investment by India.ONGC Videsh owns 26% stake in Russia's Vankor field and a 20% stake in Sakhalin-1 project. In 2009, it acquired Imperial Energy, an independent exploration and production company in Russia.Russia aims to begin shipping oil from the planned Vostok project in 2024 via the Northern Sea Route, an alternative to the Suez Canal which shortens travels to markets in Asia.Vostok Oil consists of the Vankor cluster, the West-Irkinsky area, the Payakha group of fields and the East-Taimyr cluster.",https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/oil-and-gas/ongc-evaluating-stake-buy-in-russias-vostok-oil-project/85886454,"Vostok is one of Russia's biggest oil projects, comparable in size with the

New Delhi: India is closely monitoring the developments in Mozambique as a 1000 strong Rwandan force entered the country in a bid to help Maputo fight terror groups that have been gaining a stronghold in the country. The mineral rich country is not only home to a sizable Indian diaspora but several companies including ONGC Videsh have huge investments in Mozambique.State owned ONGC Videsh Ltd and Oil India Ltd along with other foreign investors had secured $14.9 billion debt to part-finance their $24.1 billion liquefied natural gas (LNG) project being built on the Afungi peninsula.The project with one of the largest investments in Africa, is led by the French behemoth Total Energies, is expected to produce 12.88 million tonnes per annum of LNG.Following the Islamic State (IS)- orchestrated ghastly attacks in the resort town of Palma, Cabo Delgado province very close to the LNG project, Total recalled its entire staff force from the site. Work has been currently stalled at the site.""French behemoth Total Energies is the operator for Area1 Mozambique LNG Project. The Operator had to temporarily stop the work due to force majeure situation and the project activities shall start as soon as the security situation becomes manageable from safety and security point of view,"" ONGC Videsh in an emailed response to India Narrative's queries said.The Mozambique Oil and Gas Chamber had said that the attacks are aimed at disrupting the project which ""will fundamentally recast the fortunes of Mozambique from one of the poorest countries in the world to possibly a middle-income country"".Leading energy expert Narendra Taneja told India Narrative that terror activities dampen investors' confidence. ""There are temporary financial losses as the work has to be halted,"" Taneja said. However, he added that there is no threat to the assets or the reserves as such as they are underground, underwater. This particular field is prolific with proven high gas reserves, and is safe.India's total investment in Mozambique amounts to $8 billion, accounting for 25 per cent of the total Indian capital invested on the African continent, Club of Mozambique pointed out.According to the BBC, last month Rwanda sent 1,000 soldiers to Mozambique to fight the militants, who launched an insurgency in 2017 that has left more than 3,000 people dead and 820,000 displaced.""The Mozambican armed force have been struggling to regain control of the province,"" BBC said. The Observer Research Foundation in a report said that Islamist armed insurgency has alarmingly increased in Mozambique.""What began as a local religious sect has now morphed into a violent Islamic insurgency, led by the jihadist group Ahlu Sunnah Wa-Jama'a (ASJW), locally known as 'Al Shabaab',"" it said.Given India's high stakes in the West Indian Ocean that washes the shores of East Africa including Mozambique, the Indian Navy's involvement in securing the region is on New Delhi's radar. In fact, India's warship, Talwar, has just concluded participation in in Cutlass Express 2021 of the East African coastline of the Indian Ocean. The warship exercised in massive multinational manoeuvres steered by the Africa Command of the United States. The participants included 12 East African countries, the UK, European Union Naval Force Somalia (EUNAVFOR), Critical Maritime Routes Indian Ocean (CRIMARIO), EUCAP Somalia, and Interpol, apart from the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).""Due to the strategic location of Mozambique and one of the longest coast line in its southern eastern part, Mozambique provides a good opportunity for India to enhance maritime cooperation since the Mozambican navy does not have the capacity to protect its coast,"" noted Vivekananda International Foundation It added that Mozambique may very soon have the fourth largest reserves of gas in the world behind Russia, Iran and Qatar. Hence, India's engagement and investments in Mozambique's energy sector are also increasing.(The content is being carried under an arrangement with indianarrative.com)",https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/oil-and-gas/after-fresh-crackdown-on-isis-indian-oil-majors-could-be-back-in-business-in-mozambique/85291170,"The mineral rich country is not only home to a sizable Indian diaspora but

OVL loses operating rights for Iran’s Farzad-B gas field,OVL loses operating rights for Iran’s Farzad-B gas field,"State-owned ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) lost development rights for the Farzad-B giant gas field in Iran to Iranian Petropars Group. OVL owns 40 per cent participating interest (PI) in the block in which gas discovery was first made by a consortium led by ONGC.

Indian Oil Corporation too owns 40 per cent of PI, with Oil India holding the remaining 20 per cent PI in the block. Issues in negotiations between OVL and Iranian authorities as well as US sanctions led to the failure of multiple negotiations between the company and Iranian regulators to finalise a development plan.

“The National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) has signed a contract worth $1.78 billion with Petropars Group for the development of Farzad-B Gas Field in the Persian Gulf,” the Iranian Oil Ministry’s official news service Shana reported.

The gas field, which has in-place reserves of about 651 billion cubic metres of gas reserves, is expected to record about 28 million metric standard cubic meters per day (MMSCMD) of production within five years. India’s total gas consumption in FY21 was about 166 MMSCMD.

Sources told The Indian Express that Tehran had told India in January 2020 that it would develop the Farzad-B Gas field on its own. It had, however, kept the door open for India to join later.

An official, privy to the discussions, said that “In January 2020, we were informed that in the immediate future, Iran would develop the field on its own and would like to involve India appropriately at a later stage.”

Experts noted that a loss of operating rights was key as it would mean that ONGC was largely out of the driver’s seat for an investment in which it was among the largest stakeholders.

“Typically when a large player like ONGC has a major participating interest, it is likely that they also get operating rights which allows then to enhance or cut production as required and coordinate their capital expenditure,” said an expert who did not wish to be quoted noting that while ONGC would still be consulted as a key stakeholder, the operations would be controlled by the Petropars group. The expert noted that an operator separate from the largest stakeholder could also lead to a lack of transparency and inefficiencies in procurement.

OVL had signed the exploration service contract for the block in 2002 and the block was deemed commercially viable in 2008 after a discovery of gas was made by a consortium of companies led by OVL. Differences between regulators and OVL on terms of development and international sanctions on Iran led to a development plan submitted by OVL in 2011 not being approved.

Negotiations were restarted with Iranian regulators in 2015, under a new integrated contract covering upstream and downstream including monetisation/ marketing of the processed gas but negotiation remained inconclusive. ONGC proposed a revised development plan in March 2017.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/ovl-loses-operating-rights-for-irans-farzad-b-gas-field-7320606/,"State-owned ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) lost development rights for the Farzad-B

ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL), the overseas investment arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), had in 2008 discovered a giant gas field in the Farsi offshore exploration block.OVL and its partners had offered to invest up to $11 billion for the development of the discovery, which was later named Farzad-B.PTI had on October 18, 2020, reported that NIOC had informed OVL of its intention to conclude the contract for Farzad-B development with an Iranian company, in an apparent rejection of the Indian firm's bid.After this, it kept sitting on OVL's investment proposal for years.The 3,500 square kilometer Farsi block sits in a water depth of 20-90 metres on the Iranian side of the Persian Gulf.OVL, with 40 per cent operatorship interest, signed the Exploration Service Contract (ESC) for the block on December 25, 2002. Other partners included Indian Oil Corp (IOC) with 40 per cent stake and Oil India holding the remaining 20 per cent stake.OVL discovered gas in the block, which was declared commercially viable by NIOC, on August 18, 2008. The exploration phase of the ESC expired on June 24, 2009.The firm submitted a Master Development Plan (MDP) of Farzad-B gas field in April 2011 to Iranian Offshore Oil Company (IOOC), the then designated authority by NIOC for the development of Farzad-B gas field.A Development Service Contract (DSC) of the Farzad-B gas field was negotiated till November 2012, but could not be finalized due to difficult terms and international sanctions on Iran.In April 2015, negotiations restarted with Iranian authorities to develop the Farzad-B gas field under a new Iran Petroleum Contract ( IPC ). This time, NIOC introduced Pars Oil and Gas Company (POGC) as its representative for negotiations.From April 2016, both sides negotiated to develop the Farzad-B gas field under an integrated contract covering upstream and downstream, including monetization/marketing of the processed gas. However, negotiations remained inconclusive.Meanwhile, on the basis of new studies, a revised Provisional Master Development Plan (PMDP) was submitted to POGC in March 2017, sources said, adding that in April 2019, NIOC proposed development of the gas field under the DSC and offtake of raw gas by NIOC at landfall point.However, due to the imposition of US sanctions on Iran in November 2018, technical studies could not be concluded which is a precursor for commercial negotiations.The Indian consortium has so far invested around $400 million in the block.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-loses-ongc-discovered-farzad-b-gas-field-in-iran/articleshow/82706202.cms,"India Business News: India on Monday lost the ONGC Videsh Ltd-discovered

"'Bittersweet Exit' - FAR to Sell Stake in Senegal Offshore Block to India's 
ONGC","'Bittersweet Exit' - FAR to Sell Stake in Senegal Offshore Block to India's 
ONGC","Australian oil and gas company FAR has agreed to sell its stake in Woodside-operated offshore blocks in Senegal, containing the Sangomar development, to India's ONGC Videsh.

FAR has been working to sell its Senegal assets for months, as the company had been in default over the payments of its share of costs for the development of the $4.2 billion Sangomar project, after failing to secure a loan to finance its obligations.

The company has now agreed to sell its entire interest in the Production Sharing Contract for the Rufisque, Sangomar, and Sangomar Deep Offshore Blocks (RSSD) offshore Senegal and the relevant Joint Operating Agreement to ONGC Videsh.

ONGC has agreed to pay FAR $45 million at completion, and also to reimburse FAR’s share of working capital for the RSSD Project from January 1, 2020, totaling $66.58 million, also payable on completion. The reimbursement is comprised of cash calls paid by FAR, including $29.60 million paid to cure FAR’s default to the Sangomar Joint Venture. The transaction also includes an entitlement to certain contingent payments capped at $55 million.

FAR is proposing to sell to ONGC its interest in the RSSD Project, being a 13.67% participating interest in the Sangomar exploitation area containing the Sangomar field; and a 15% participating interest in the RSSD contract area outside the Sangomar exploitation area.

FAR's Managing Director, Cath Norman said: ""We are pleased to bring this deal to our shareholders and wish to thank ONGC for their interest and cooperation over the last few months. ONGC is a very reputable group with global exploration and production interests. We believe they will be a valuable partner for Petrosen and Woodside going forward.""

""As we have acknowledged, the market for financing and selling assets has been weak since the impact of COVID was felt in March of this year. In these circumstances, the offer from ONGC represents the best option available at this time and we trust that our shareholders will vote for this transaction.""

Bittersweet exit

FAR said it expected to have approximately $130 million in cash at the close of the Senegal transaction. It plans to use the cash ""to rebuild the company"" and further its other West African prospects offshore the Gambia and Guinea-Bissau.

""Having been in the RSSD project for 14 years, it’s a bittersweet moment to be selling our stake. FAR is committed to our projects in The Gambia and Guinea-Bissau and using our deep knowledge of the MSGBC Basin to potentially explore offshore Senegal again,"" Norman said.

The RSSD project is home to the Sangomar field development which is targeting first oil in 2023. Woodside Petroleum Limited is the operator of the project, with partners being Senegal's national oil company Petrosen, and ONGC (subject to the completion of the acquisition from FAR).

Oil and gas company Cairn had been a partner in the blocks for years, but it then in July agreed to sell its whole interest to Russia's Lukoil. The Cairn-Lukoil deal was then stopped by Woodside, which exercised its partner pre-emption rights, and bought Cairn's stake. Cairn sold a 36.44% interest in the Sangomar exploitation area and a 40% interest in the remaining PSC contract area.

Far's sale to ONGC is subject to various conditions precedent including the written approval of the Minister of Petroleum and Energies for the Republic of Senegal, partners' pre-emptive rights, shareholder approval, and the termination of an agreement FAR has with a third party (details of which are currently confidential).

""FAR is presently contemplating completion of the Transaction at the end of January 2021. However, the timing of completion cannot be definitively determined at this time,"" Far said.

As previously reported, the $4.2 billion Final Investment Decision (FID) on the Sangomar field was taken at the start of 2020 and the field development has kicked off.

The recoverable hydrocarbon reserves of the Sangomar field total approximately 500 million boe. The field is planned to be brought online in 2023 via a Modec-supplied FPSO.",https://www.oedigital.com/news/483158-bittersweet-exit-far-to-sell-stake-in-senegal-offshore-block-to-india-s-ongc,"Australian oil and gas company FAR has agreed to sell its stake in

Australian oil and gas exploration firm FAR has agreed to sell its 15% stake in the $4.2bn Rufisque Offshore, Sangomar Offshore and Sangomar Deep Offshore project (RSSD) project offshore Senegal.

ONGC Videsh subsidiary ONGC Videsh Vankorneft signed the agreement with FAR to buy the stake for $45m.

ONGC Videsh is the overseas arm of Indian state-owned oil and gas company ONGC.

ONGC Videsh Vankorneft will be acquiring 13.67% participating interest in the ‘Sangomar exploitation area’. It will also buy a 15% participating interest in the RSSD contract area outside it.

ONGC has agreed to reimburse FAR’s share of working capital for the Senegalese oil project, which is $66.58m, from 1 January.

FAR will also receive contingent payments in the future, valued at $55m, which will be based on various factors with respect to the sale of oil from the RSSD project.

"Was Indian ONGC Expelled From The Iranian Farzad-B Gas Field Long Before 
The New Media Reports?","Was Indian ONGC Expelled From The Iranian Farzad-B Gas Field Long Before 
The New Media Reports?","Iran and China are in final stages of signing the 25-year Sino-Iranian Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, which will bring a windfall of investments – nearly a whopping $400 Billion to Iran in the exchange for steady energy provision to China for the same time duration.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif met Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Tengchong, in southwest China’s Yunnan province earlier in October to put final touches to the deal.

As the finalization of the massive deal nears, ripples of the same seem to have reached New Delhi. Last month Indian Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan had ensured in Lok Sabha that India’s “relations with Iran stand on their own footing and are independent of its relations with third countries” while talking about Chinese influence in the Gulf region.

In September, India’s defence minister Rajnath Singh and External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar had visited Iran. The details of the visits were not revealed but they were largely interpreted as New Delhi’s attempt at consolidating interests in Iran while it finalises deal with China.

However, on Sunday, a report by news agency Press Trust of India quotes sources as saying “India has all but lost the ONGC Videsh Ltd-discovered Farzad-B gas field in the Persian Gulf after Iran decided to prefer domestic companies over foreign firms for the development of the field”.

It is hard to ignore that the report has come just a few days after the meeting between Iran and Chinese foreign ministers and tensions between New Delhi and Beijing due to the Himalayan conflict may also add to the woes.

In July when the reports emerged that Iranian railways may have dropped India from the 628km Chabahar-Zahedan Railway Line project over delay in funds, observers had termed it as Iran’s pressure tactics on New Delhi to expedite the projects, which remain blocked due to American sanctions. The similarity is that the report had come a few days after the details of $400 billion deal were made public.

Later, both India and Iran dismissed any such development.

Furthermore, former Indian ambassador to Iran – R Dayakar while talking to the EurAsian Times stated that US influence on India-Iran relations are exaggerated as evident from India’s ongoing work at Chabahar port. He says the sanctions against Iran have ended and next month’s presidential elections in the US will decide the future course.

Stressing upon India as an important force in the region, Dayakar says: “Regardless of who develops Farzad B, they have to look at India for its gas sales. India with its massive developmental programmes has an enormous need for gas”.

However, this is not the first time that reports of India losing the gas field project have come to the fore. In 2019, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh had said: “Our intention is to hold final talks with them [India]….if they are not ready to do the project, we will continue with an Iranian company…..”

The Farzad-B gas field was discovered on the Farsi offshore exploration block in 2008 by ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL), the overseas investment arm of India’s state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC).

OVL was set to invest up to $11 billion in the gas field, which holds total reserves of around 21.7 trillion cubic feet of which around 60 per cent is recoverable, and production is slated to be around 1.1 billion cubic feet per day.

As per the sources quoted in PTI report, the National Iranian Oil Co (NIOC) had informed OVl in February about its intention to conclude the contract for Farzad-B development with an Iranian company. However, continuing the engagement with NIOC, OVl was seeking terms and conditions of the proposed contract for its evaluation, as per the sources, but Iran did not respond to the request.

The report seems contradictory as, in July, The Hindu had reported that the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) revealed that OVL had been cut out of the development of Farzad B. The report had termed US sanctions, Iran’s changing conditions and fluctuating prices and India’s delayed responses as causes of lost investment opportunity.

At the same time, wire service Indo-Asian News Service (IANS) had quoted sources in the Indian oil ministry as saying that Indian consortium – comprising of Indian Oil, Oil India and OVL, which bagged the exploration contract for Farzad-B in 2002 – may remain invested in the project as equity partners without operatorship or development rights. With this, the consortium will get their share of gas to India at applicable rates decided by Iran, the report had said.",https://www.eurasiantimes.com/was-indian-ongc-expelled-from-iranian-farzad-b-gas-field-long-before-the-new-media-reports/,"Iran and China are in final stages of signing the 25-year Sino-Iranian

ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL), the overseas investment arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), had in 2008 discovered a giant gas field in the Farsi offshore exploration block.

OVL and its partners had offered to invest up to USD 11 billion for development of the discovery, which was later named Farzad-B.

After sitting over OVL’s proposal for years, the National Iranian Oil Co (NIOC) informed the firm in February this year about its intention to conclude the contract for Farzad-B development with an Iranian company, sources with direct knowledge of the development said.

OVL, however, continued its engagements with NIOC over the development of the field and sought terms and conditions of the proposed contract for its evaluation, they said, adding that Iran has so far not responded to the Indian firm’s request.

Farzad-B holds total reserves of around 21.7 trillion cubic feet of which around 60 per cent is recoverable, and production is slated to be around 1.1 billion cubic feet per day.

Sources said unconfirmed information suggests that Iran has identified a local firm for the development of the field, but OVL has not yet given up hopes and continues to chase Iranian authorities for the contract.

The 3,500 square kilometre Farsi block sits in water depth of 20-90 metres on the Iranian side of the Persian Gulf.

OVL, with 40 per cent operatorship interest, signed the Exploration Service Contract (ESC) for the block on December 25, 2002. Other partners included Indian Oil Corp (IOC) with 40 per cent stake and Oil India Ltd (OIL) holding the remaining 20 per cent stake.

OVL discovered gas in the block, which was declared commercially viable by NIOC, on August 18, 2008. The exploration phase of the ESC expired on June 24, 2009.

The firm submitted a Master Development Plan (MDP) of Farzad-B gas field in April 2011 to Iranian Offshore Oil Company (IOOC), the then designated authority by NIOC for development of Farzad-B gas field.

A Development Service Contract (DSC) of Farzad-B gas field was negotiated till November 2012, but could not be finalized due to difficult terms and international sanctions on Iran.

In April 2015, negotiations restarted with Iranian authorities to develop Farzad-B gas field under a new Iran Petroleum Contract (IPC). This time, NIOC introduced Pars Oil and Gas Company (POGC) as its representative for negotiations.

From April 2016, both sides negotiated to develop Farzad-B gas field under an integrated contract covering upstream and downstream, including monetization/marketing of the processed gas. However, negotiations remained inconclusive.

Meanwhile, on the basis of a new studies, a revised Provisional Master Development Plan (PMDP) was submitted to POGC in March 2017, sources said, adding that in April 2019, NIOC proposed development of the gas field under the DSC and offtake of raw gas by NIOC at landfall point.

However, due to imposition of US sanctions on Iran in November 2018, technical studies could not be concluded which is a precursor for commercial negotiations.

New Delhi: India's Oil and Natural Gas Corp ( ONGC ) has exited from Sudan oilfields after the African nation refused to pay for oil it lifted from the fields. ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL), the overseas investment arm of the state-owned firm, as also its Chinese partner CNPC and Malaysia's Petronas have withdrawn from the block, a top company official said.OVL had a 25 per cent stake in Block 2A&4 in Sudan while CNCP had 40 per cent and Petronet 30 per cent. Sudan's Sudapet had 5 per cent interest.Sudan had since 2011 not paid OVL and partners for oil it bought from the block. Sudan's dues towards OVL totalled USD 430.69 million, the official said.The company initiated arbitration proceedings against the Government of Sudan to recover the dues and has terminated the Exploration and Production Sharing Agreement (EPSA), he said.OVL had also not been paid about USD 99 million for the 741-km-long pipeline it built from Khartoum to Port Sudan.The project cost and rental of USD 254 million was to be paid by Sudan in 18 half-yearly equated instalments of USD 14.135 million each starting from December 30, 2005. The company got a total of 11 instalments (USD 155.48 million) till December 2010 and the balance seven instalments amounting to USD 98.94 million remained outstanding.The official said falling to get the balance payment even after using diplomatic channels, OVL has initiated a separate arbitration to recover the outstanding dues.OVL had entered Sudan in 2003 by acquiring a 25 per cent interest in the Greater Nile Oil Project.GNOP consisted of the upstream assets of on-land Blocks 1, 2 and 4 spread over 49,500 sq km in the Muglad Basin , located about 780 km South-West of the capital city of Khartoum in Sudan.Upon the secession of South Sudan from Sudan in July 2011, the contract areas of Blocks 1, 2 and 4 which straddle between Sudan and South Sudan were split with a major share of production and reserves are now situated in South Sudan.Post-secession, as the government of Sudan's share of total production from Sudan was not sufficient to meet the requirements of local refineries, foreign firms were asked to sell their share of crude oil to it.However, the payment of dues on account of crude oil purchased by the government of Sudan was not received, the official said.Sudan had denied ONGC and partners an extension of licence to operate block 2B after the initial contract expired in November 2016.OVL had, along with state-owned Oil India Ltd, constructed and financed a 741-km multi-product pipeline from Khartoum refinery to Port Sudan for USD 194 million.OVL's share of the project cost was 90 per cent, while the rest was borne by OIL.The pipeline was handed over to the government of Sudan in October 2005. The lump-sum price, together with lease rent was required to be paid to OVL in 18 equal half-yearly instalments effective from December 2005.This amount totalled USD 254 million.OVL has participating interest in 37 oil and gas projects in 17 countries spanning from Venezuela to Vietnam.The official said oil production at Block 1, 2 & 4 in South Sudan was shut in December 2013 due to security reasons and production is now being resumed.",https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/oil-and-gas/frustrated-with-non-payment-of-dues-ongc-exits-from-sudan/78143224,"New Delhi: India's Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has exited from Sudan

STORY","GUPTA TIPPED AS MD ONGC VIDESH A POST VACANT SINCE FEBRUARY 2019 AN INSIDE 
STORY","If some well-placed sources are to be believed the search-cum-selection-committee (SCSC) on Thursday recommended the name of Atul Kumar Gupta (Director- Operations, OVL) for the post of Managing Director, ONGC Videsh Limited (OVL); India's flagship firm for acquisition of oil and gas assets abroad.

Reportedly, over a dozen candidates were called for interaction including few senior IAS officers for the post which is lying vacant since 01 February 2019 after Narendra K Verma retired on 31 January 2019. Subject to requisite clearances and ACC approval he will become new MD of OVL.

After keeping the post vacant for nearly a year the NaMo Govt in January 2020 constituted the SCSC inviting applications by 06 February 2020.

It would be interesting to mention that the PESB had started the hunting process of MD, OVL well on time i.e. six months prior to the post falling vacant. The Petroleum Ministry, reportedly, wanted SCSC route instead of the PESB route but differences with several departments over bureaucrats applying delayed the process.

The post was exempted from the 'Rule of immediate absorption' (i.e. resigning from service) and candidates (JS level and above) were allowed to apply on a deputation basis. If some insiders are to be believed the Oil Ministry was inclined to post an IFS officer on a deputation basis but it somehow it could not happen.

Finally, the SCSC has recommended Alok Kumar Gupta’s name for MD, OVL; a wholly-owned subsidiary of ONGC with over 40 projects in 19 countries and investment worth USD 29.28 billion. Ironically, in the absence of a regular incumbent OVL did not make a single acquisition in 2019.",https://www.indianmandarins.com/news/gupta-tipped-as-md-ongc-videsh-a-post-vacant-since-february-2019-an-inside-story/20979,"If some well-placed sources are to be believed the

"CBI books Videocon’s Dhoot, others for Mozambique block stake deals","CBI books Videocon’s Dhoot, others for Mozambique block stake deals","The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has alleged irregularities in the acquisition of Videocon Industries Ltd’s stake in the Golfinho-Atum field in the Rovuma Area 1 Offshore Block in Mozambique. These allegations were made when the CBI filed an FIR on Tuesday, suspecting criminal conspiracy, cheating and criminal misconduct that led to ‘pecuniary gains’ to Videocon Industries.

The CBI FIR said that unknown officers of lender banks led by State Bank of India, in conspiracy with Videocon Chairman and Managing Director Venugopal Dhoot, have caused wrongful gain to Videocon and wrongful loss to Indian PSU banks.

The CBI said a preliminary enquiry was registered against unknown officials of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, ONGC-Videsh Ltd (OVL), Oil India Ltd (OIL), Bharat Petro Resources Ltd (BPRL) and a consortium of banks (SBI, IDBI and ICICI Bank) led by SBI Cap. It is alleged that they colluded with the directors and promoters of Videocon Mozambique Rovuma 1 Limited (VMRL), a subsidiary of Videocon Hydrocarbons Holding Ltd (VHHL), with an intent to cause 'undue gains' to Videocon Industries Ltd.

Videocon acquired 10 per cent participating interest in the Golfinho-Atum field in the Rovuma Area 1 Offshore Block in Mozambique in 2008. OVL and OIL had acquired the Mozambique asset from Videocon in January 2014 for $ 2519 million, the CBI said.

The enquiry revealed that in April 2012, the consortium led by SBI sanctioned a Standby Letter of Credit facility of $2,773.60 million to Videocon Hydrocarbon Holdings. This amount was to be used for the development of their oil and gas assets in Mozambique, Brazil and Indonesia, and other funding requirements, including refinancing existing loans.

The CBI alleges that the SBI led consortium refinanced some loans of Standard Chartered Bank, London that were to be paid by Videocon. But the SBI consortium did not take charge of any oil and gas assets in return for paying off these loans.

Further, when the sale of Videocon’s stake in the Mozambique asset to the OVL-OIL-BPRL consortium took place, Standard Chartered Bank pocketed $705.45 million, instead of the $650 million that initially was agreed upon. This $650 million liability had come about because Videocon continued to take more loans from Standard Chartered Bank, despite being directed to not do so. The SBI led consortium did not flag this issue too, according to the CBI.

CBI also said that Videocon siphoned a portion of the amount borrowed from banks for developing oil and gas assets to its other businesses and promoters accounts.

“Well Sol-1, in the block CPO-5 encountered the oil-bearing sands of 8 meters at a depth of 2,852 meters. Oil discovery in Sol-1 confirms the extent of oil pay further south of the block,” it said.

OVL had previously discovered commercial oil in the same pay in wells Mariposa-1 and Indico-1 in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Both the wells are under production now.

The Indian firm is the operator of the Colombian block with 70 per cent participating interest (PI) while the balance 30 per cent stake is owned by Petrodorado South America SA, Sucursal (PDSA), Colombia.

OVL said in Brazil, well Moita Bonita-2 encountered natural gas reserves at water depth of 2.6 kilometers.

Brazilian national oil company Petrobras is the operator of block BM-SEAL-4 consortium with a 75 per cent stake. OVL holds the remaining 25 per cent interest.

The well “encountered gas-bearing sand of total thickness of 39 meters at the depth of 5,227 meters and oil-bearing sand of total thickness of 24 meters at deeper depths. Drill Stem Test (DST) was performed in the gas carrier interval 5,252 meters to 5,291 meters, and the result showed good production from the reservoir,” the statement.

OVL has a significant presence in the oil and gas sectors of Brazil and Colombia.

It has stakes in seven exploratory blocks in Colombia. In addition, it is the joint owner of the oil producing company Mansarovar Energy Colombia Ltd (MECL) along with its partners Sinopec of China.

In Brazil, OVL holds 27 per cent interest in the offshore BC-10 block beside the block BM Seal-4.

Block BM Seal-4 is located in the Sergipe Alagoas Offshore Basin in Northern Brazil and has an area of 320 sq km with water depths ranging from 1,500 to 2,700 meters.

The company has stakes in 40 projects in 20 countries spanning from Colombia to New Zealand.

Sea","ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), has sought yet another two-year extension to explore a Vietnamese oil block in the contested waters of the South China Sea. A company handout photograph shows an offshore platform in the Lan Tay field in Vietnam, owned partly by BP Plc, ONGC Videsh Ltd. and Vietnamese government-owned Petro-Vietnam.(VIA BLOOMBERG NEWS / File Photo)

Officials said OVL has applied for a sixth extension to explore Block-128, the licence for which was valid till June 15, 2019.

While India wants to maintain its strategic interest in the South China Sea, Vietnam wants an Indian firm to counter China’s interventions in the contested waters.

The officials said OVL had in May applied to the Vietnamese authorities for the sixth extension of the exploration licence for the deepsea block and is likely to get it.

“We have a commitment to drill one well on the block and to fulfil that we have sought an extension,” one of the officials said.

Another official said the company had a couple of years ago drilled a well on the block but it could not reach the target depth and so it now has to drill the well all over again.

“If we don’t drill, we are liable to pay penalties,” he said.

OVL had signed production sharing contract (PSC) for the 7,058 sq km Block 128 in offshore Phu Khanh Basin, Vietnam, on May 24, 2006. The Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), Vietnam, issued an investment licence for the block on June 16, 2006, being effective date of the PSC.

The company has not found any hydrocarbon in the block but is continuing to stay invested to maintain India’s strategic interest.

OVL first took a two-year extension of the exploration period till June 2014 and then another one year. A third extension was granted on May 28, 2015, and a fourth in 2016. It got the fifth extension for two years in 2017.

The company has so far invested USD 50.88 million in the block.

The block lies in the part of the South China Sea over which China claims sovereignty. In 2011, Beijing had warned OVL that its exploration activities off the Vietnam coast were illegal and violated Chinas sovereignty, but the company continued exploring for oil and gas.

OVL made a foray into Vietnam as early as 1988, when it bagged the exploration licence for Block 6.1.

Last month, China sent its coast guard ships into Block 6.01.

“Their (Chinese) vessel came 5 nautical miles near the oil rig on the block on August 13. They withdrew after a couple of days,” the official said adding that operations in the block were not affected.

This, he said, was the third instance of Chinese vessel intruding into the block, where Russia’s Rosneft is the operator.

OVL owns 45 per cent stake in Block 6.01 and its share of production was 2.023 billion cubic metres of gas and 0.036 million tonnes of condensate.

The 955 sq km Block 06.1 located in Nam Con Son basin has two producing fields -- Lan Tay and Lan Rosneft -- and has 35 per cent stake while the remaining 20 per cent is with PetroVietnam.

The firm had in 2006 got two exploration blocks -- Block 127 and Block 128. While Block 127 was relinquished due to poor prospectives, the other block was retained.

The first extension for Block 128 followed China putting the area under Block 128 for global bidding.

China claims sovereignty over most of the South China Sea where the two blocks are located and had warned the Indian arm from drilling in the region.

ONGC Videsh to miss disinvestment bus despite Modi govt’s ambitious target,ONGC Videsh to miss disinvestment bus despite Modi govt’s ambitious target,"“ONGC Videsh is still heavily dependent on the parent company for manpower and other critical operations. Though the company has registered strong financial performance, it may not be a prudent decision to list it as a separate entity at this stage,” a government official not wishing to be named told ThePrint.

The Modi government has decided to proceed with an aggressive disinvestment programme, with a revised target of Rs 1.05 lakh crore, but is not comfortable with the idea of launching an initial public offering for OVL.

New Delhi: The Narendra Modi government might be keen to take a number of central public sector enterprises to the stock market, but it has put the plan to list ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) — the overseas investment arm of the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation — on the backburner.

Last year in December, ONGC was toying with the idea of listing the profitable OVL as a separate company. The proposal, however, did not see the light of the day as market conditions were not conducive.

The government has also decided, as reported first by ThePrint, to put on hold the proposal of merging public sector oil companies. The focus instead will be on increasing domestic production.

Sources said there will be no mergers of oil PSUs in the immediate future after the marriage between ONGC and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) led to multiple problems.

Review of all projects

OVL has made investments in oil and gas projects in numerous countries, including Iran, Venezuela, Colombia and Mozambique.

Sources said the government might review all major investments made overseas by OVL to ensure that each of them functions smoothly, and avoid any disruption.

Last month, an informal ministerial group under Union Home Minister Amit Shah held a meeting to review the $2.2-2.4 billion investment proposal in Mozambique by the Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd. Besides Shah, the meeting was attended by Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal, among others.

Earlier, in the wake of falling global crude prices, Pradhan had raised concerns over investments made by public sector firms in the Rovuma Offshore Area-1 in Mozambique. The investments made during the UPA era were estimated at about $6 billion.

“There is a need for regular reviews by top level officials as these include huge investments overseas and there is little scope to go wrong,” the official quoted above said.

Amid rising geopolitical tensions, India’s total crude oil production has been a cause for concern. The country’s total crude production was 37.5 million metric tonnes in 2014-15, but has fallen to 34.2 million metric tonnes in 2018-19, leading to increased imports.

ONGC Videsh Ltd and its Indian as well as foreign partners have agreed to invest $20 billion in constructing a gas liquefaction and export terminal in Mozambique to monetise vast offshore natural gas reserves they had found.

In separate but almost identical regulatory filings, Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) said their subsidiaries along with Anadarko Petroleum of the US has taken a final investment decision (FID) for Area-1 Mozambique LNG project.

The project will initially consist of two LNG trains with a total nameplate capacity of 12.88 million tonnes per annum. Feedgas will come from the Golfinho/Atum field in Offshore Area 1.

To be built on the Afungi peninsula in Cabo Delgado province, the project will also involve the construction of associated infrastructure, storage tanks, and export jetty facilities.

The LNG project will be fed with nearly 100 million cubic feet of natural gas a day from the Golfinho/Atum fields in the Rovuma Basin, which are set to be developed as part of the Offshore Area 1 gas project.

The project commissioning is planned for 2024.

""OVL, a wholly owned subsidiary of ONGC, the national oil company of India, announces that Rovuma Offshore Area-1 consortium has taken an FID for the two trains Golfinho/Atum Mozambique LNG Project,"" the company said in the filing.

""Mozambique LNG project will be the first onshore LNG facility in Mozambique consisting of initial two LNG trains with a total nameplate capacity of 12.88 million tonnes per annum supported by the development of the Golfinho/Atum fields located offshore entirely within Area-1.""

Japanese company Mitsui has 20 percent stake, Mozambique's state energy company ENH has 15 percent interest and the remaining 8.5 percent is with Thailand's PTT.

Anadarko and its partners have locked in long-term sales and purchase agreements (SPAs) from the project for a total of 11.1 million tonnes per year. They include SPAs with Tokyo Gas, Centrica, Shell, China's CNOOC, France's EDF and Indonesia's Pertamina, among others.

OVL makes oil discovery in Colombia,OVL makes oil discovery in Colombia,"ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), Saturday said it has made a second oil discovery in Colombia that has increased prospects of its onland block in the South American nation.

The well Indico-1 in onshore block CPO-5 found an oil-bearing play, the company said in a statement.

OVL is the operator of the block with 70 per cent stake while Petrodorado South America S A Sucursal (PDSA) of Colombia holds the remaining 30 per cent.

The well was spudded on November 7, 2018, and the company completed drilling on December 15, 2018.

""The well Indico-1 encountered Lower Sands (LS-3) of Une Formation (Cretaceous) at a depth of 9,833 feet found to be oil bearing, before terminating the drilling at 10,602 feet (MD) in Paleozoic. The well was successfully logged and found to have 284 feet of gross thickness and 241 feet net pay,"" it said.

During tests, the well flowed at a self-flow rate of about 4,000 barrels of oil per day.

""Currently, the well is under Short-Term Testing with multi-bean study for further evaluation,"" it said.

OVL had earlier discovered commercial oil of 40-degree API in LS-3 sands in the well Mariposa-1 in the block in 2017, which is located 6.5 km from Indico-1, and the continuation of same play is confirmed in the recent well.

The company now plans to drill more exploratory wells to chase this important Cretaceous clastic corridor in immediate future.

ONGC Videsh twice lucky in Colombia,ONGC Videsh twice lucky in Colombia,"ONGC Videsh, the overseas arm of state- owned explorer ONGC, has made a second oil discovery in Colombia that has raised the prospects of its onland block in the South American nation.

The well, Indico-1, is in the onshore block CPO-5, the company said in a statement on Saturday.

OVL is the operator of the block with a 70 per cent stake while Petrodorado South America S A Sucursal (PDSA) of Colombia holds the remaining 30 per cent.

Drilling began on November 7, 2018 and was completed on December 15, 2018.

OVL had earlier discovered commercial oil in the well Mariposa-1 in the block in 2017, which is located 6.5 km from Indico-1, and the continuation of same play is confirmed in the recent well.

The company now plans to drill more exploratory wells to chase this important oil corridor in the immediate future.

OVL is also acquiring additional 3D Seismic data to map more drillable areas in other sectors of the block.

“Indico-1 encountered Lower Sands (LS-3) of Une Formation (Cretaceous) at a depth of 9,833 feet and found to be oil bearing, before terminating the drilling at 10,602 feet (MD) in Paleozoic. The well was successfully logged and found to have 284 feet of gross thickness and 241 feet of net pay,” the statement said.

During tests, the well flowed at a self-flow rate of about 4,000 barrels of oil per day. “Currently, the well is under Short-Term Testing with multi-bean study for further evaluation,” it said.

OVL, which has a stake in 41 projects in 20 countries, has a significant presence in the Colombian oil and gas sector and holds a stake in six exploratory blocks in addition to a producing 50:50 joint venture, Mansarovar Energy Colombia Ltd (MECL). Under its portfolio, OVL has reserves of 711 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent natural gas.

The board of ONGC had recently decided against listing its overseas arm as the market conditions were not conducive.

Company officials said ONGC Videsh has assets in countries such as Venezuela, Iran, and Sudan, which are exposed to some or other Western sanctions. These assets will have to be first separated from the company. While this may not be a difficult task, it would involve issues of capital gains and tax thereon.

Also, OVL is heavily in debt and a flotation proposal would require taking approval of all lenders—yet another tedious job.

Butola’s death casts shadow of grief over ONGC & Indian Oil,Butola’s death casts shadow of grief over ONGC & Indian Oil,"By RAJ KANWAR

The sad demise on Monday in Delhi of RS Butola has cast a shadow of grief over two giant petroleum companies, Indian Oil Corporation and ONGC Videsh Ltd, of which he was the head honcho. He was only 64. His distinguished career span that began as a banker in 1975 and culminated as the Chairman of Indian Oil Corporation was a continuous saga of one achievement after another.

In his tribute, ONGC CMD Shashi Shanker described Butola as ‘an immaculate professional and thorough gentleman who had steered two large oil companies viz ONGC Videsh Ltd and Indian Oil Corporation with unimpeachable managerial acumen and profound leadership skills. He was an inspiration personified for all of us. His untimely death is an irreparable loss to the oil and gas industry.”

Many other colleagues of Butola also expressed their grief at the demise of a great oil technocrat and a benevolent human being.

RS Sharma, former CMD, ONGC says, “I have personal reasons to feel grieved at the sad demise of Mr Butola as we were family friends as bachelors. We both worked in the Credit Appraisal Deptt of the Union Bank Zonal Office in Delhi in the late 1970s. Ranbir was one of the finest persons I ever came across. Indeed, a very dependable, trustworthy and unassuming friend. To cap it, a top class professional. It is a very big personal loss for me.”

Atul Chandra, first Managing Director of ONGC Videsh Ltd says of Butola, “He started his international oil odyssey with me at OVL. He was most dependable, very competent and highly intelligent, yet a very humble human being. I will greatly miss him.”

Ajit Hazarika, former CMD, ONGC, says, “Butolaji was a very good friend of mine. We worked together and played Golf together. He was a fine gentleman, always having a smiling face and with ready to help others’ attitude. His sudden death has surprised all of us, though we knew that he was unwell and was recovering at home.”

“However, due to doctor’s advice, none of us could meet him during his hospitalisation. It has saddened us more because we could not meet him even though we lived in the same neighbourhood. We learnt with some relief that he had been discharged from the Gangaram Hospital and recovering well after a successful surgery. We looked forward to meeting him once it was allowed by the doctor, but God had willed otherwise. And then we got the news of his death on Monday evening. That was simply shocking and unbelievable. A large number of his kin and friends from IOC, ONGC, OVL and the Ministry attended the funeral on 18 December to pay their respects to the departed soul. His demise is a great loss to humanity and the country’s petroleum industry.”

As Indian Oil Corporation’s Chairman for over three years (February 2011-May 2014), he brought about a transformational shift in its business philosophy that put IOC on an accelerated growth trajectory. The series of initiatives then taken by him in the refining, marketing and other segments brought about a significant improvement not only in its profitability but also substantially enhanced its market image.

As a general manager in ONGC, which he had joined in February 1991, Butola was instrumental in conducting appraisal of large projects including Bombay High Re-Development Project, etc. Then, for the following five years, Butola was on deputation to the Government of India. It was during that period that he demonstrated his appraisal and analytical ability and oversaw the implementation of ONGC’s very first ERP project. He was also the Lead Negotiator for ONGC’s first ever series of crude oil sales agreements that were signed upon dismantling of Administered Pricing Mechanism (APM).

His tenure as the Managing Director and CEO of ONGC Videsh Ltd turned out to be an epoch-making one and gave this wholly-owned subsidiary of ONGC unique international brand equity. From a fringe entity, OVL soon acquired a formidable reputation and emerged as a significant international oil and gas player with its footprints extending to 16 countries from the earlier four. Under his stewardship, OVL achieved unprecedented growth with its contribution to the Indian oil and gas kitty rising from 0.25 MMt in 2002-03 and 3.87 MMt in 2003-04 to an all time high of 9.45 MMt in 2010-11. Its profits jumped from a meagre Rs 59 crore in 2002-03 and Rs 428 crore in 2003-04 to Rs 2,690 crore in 2010-11.

Butola undoubtedly was one of the most versatile oil and gas professionals in India with over two decades of deep insights across upstream, downstream and even midstream sectors including petrochemicals. Thus, by leading two large companies in the upstream and downstream sectors, Butola achieved what very few men had achieved before — the unique distinction of having such a wide and comprehensive exposure to the entire spectrum of the exciting petroleum industry.

"ONGC Videsh Ltd slapped with Rs 7,666-crore service tax demand","ONGC Videsh Ltd slapped with Rs 7,666-crore service tax demand","New Delhi: The tax department has slapped ONGC Videsh Ltd a service tax demand of Rs 7,666.10 crore on remittance the firm makes to its overseas subsidiaries for past one decade, sources in know of the development said.

OVL, the overseas arm of State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), has stakes in 41 projects in 20 countries spanning from Venezuela to New Zealand. For the operations of these projects, the local units and joint ventures would raise a demand for money on the parent, OVL, which would transmit the funds.

The service tax department now contends that the overseas units are rendering a service to OVL and as such the company is liable to pay service tax at the full rate, sources said.

The tax demand pertains to the period 2006 to 2017.

The service tax department had first issued a demand-show-cause notice on October 11, 2011, requiring OVL to show cause why service tax amounting to Rs 2,816.31 crore plus interest on such amount and penalty should not be demanded and recovered.

The tax amount was calculated based on foreign currency expenditure reported in the company's financial statements covering the period from April 1, 2006 to March 31, 2010.

Sources said the tax department contends that these expenses represent business auxiliary services rendered by the foreign branches and operator of the joint venture/ consortium to OVL.

Subsequently, five more demand-cum-show cause notices have been issued based on similar contentions covering the period up to March 31, 2015, to show cause why service tax amounting to Rs 3,286.36 crore (including Education cess and SHE cess), the interest on such amount and penalty should not be demanded and recovered from the company.

A demand-show cause notice has been issued based on similar contentions covering the period April 1, 2015, to March 31, 2017, to show cause why service tax amounting to Rs 1,563.32 crore plus interest on such amount and penalty should not be demanded and recovered from OVL.

Sources said OVL believes that no service tax is due or payable and is contesting the demand.

According to OVL, investments made overseas through subsidiaries or branches or joint ventures do not constitute availing of any service. The company operates the projects at an internal rate of return on investments of 12-13% and if it has to pay 14-15%^ service tax on such investments, the projects will give negative returns and would become infructuous.

Also, it contends that service tax by law can be levied on services rendered within the country. And even if one were to assume that its branches or subsidiaries were rendering any service, they were all overseas and not within India and so cannot be subject to any service tax, sources said.

Sources said OVL management is of the view that the disputed service-tax demands are not tenable in law.

OVL had reported a net profit of Rs 981.5 crore in 2017-18 fiscal on a turnover of Rs 12,945.6 crore. It produced 9,353 million tonnes of oil in the fiscal, up from 8.434 million tonnes in the previous year.

Petronet to partner OVL for stake in Qatar Petroleum LNG project,Petronet to partner OVL for stake in Qatar Petroleum LNG project,"New Delhi: Petronet LNG Ltd is keen to partner with ONGC Videsh Ltd to buy a stake in Qatar Petroleum's upcoming gas exploration and liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects, its MD and CEO Prabhat Singh said.

Qatar Petroleum plans to expand LNG production capacity from 77 million tonnes per year to 100 million tonnes in next few years. Petronet is keen to take 5 per cent stake in the expansion project along with associated upstream gas development, he said.

State-owned Qatar Petroleum, which consolidated its two LNG producing companies - Qatargas and RasGas, into itself earlier this year, is looking to form a joint venture with international partners to deliver the North Field expansion.

""We had meetings with them and they have asked us to give a business proposal,"" Singh said, adding the joint team of Petronet and OVL is keen to visit data room to firm their views. Petronet currently buys 7.5 million tonnes of LNG per annum from RasGas of Qatar under a 25-year contract.

RasGas had in the contract promised to give 5 per cent stake to Petronet or its nominee in the liquefication plant in the Gulf nation. But Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), which was assigned to pick up the equity, hesitated in making the USD 135 million payment. The stake is now worth USD 2 billion.

Singh said Qatar has announced plans to produce 100 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) annually - equivalent to a third of current global supplies - in the next five to seven years, up from current 77 million tonnes.

Petronet is keen to get ownership of gas molecule at the well-head and so wants a stake in both the upstream development and LNG production facility, he said.

The stake would help Petronet, which is India's biggest LNG importer, better understand the business of converting natural gas extracted from under-sea fields are converted into a liquid at sub-zero temperature, shipped and marketed world over.

This will be its first investment in an LNG production plant. Petronet operates a 15 million tonnes per annum terminal at Dahej in Gujarat for import of LNG and converting the liquid fuel back to its gaseous state before piping it to customers. Singh said Petronet wants to acquire a stake that will guarantee it a board position.

The offer made to Petronet in lieu of LNG purchases was the same that RasGas had promised Korea's KoGas in an LNG supply deal. Article 30.7 of the agreement with Petronet promised the stake at ""no premium"" but RasGas reneged on its commitment and demanded a premium from ONGC, which was nominated to take the stake.

ONGC Videsh buys stake in Azeri fields for $1 billion,ONGC Videsh buys stake in Azeri fields for $1 billion,"ONGC Videsh Ltd will acquire Hess Corporation’s 2.72 per cent stake in the Azeri, Chirag and Guneshli (ACG) oil and gas fields in Azerbaijan.

The acquisition marks OVL’s entry into oil-rich Azerbaijan.

According to an OVL statement, the definitive agreements for the acquisition of Hess Corporation’s participating interest in oil fields in the Azerbaijan part of the Caspian Sea and 2.36 per cent interest in the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline (BTC) is for $1 billion (Rs 5,535 crore).

“The acquisition is subject to relevant Government and regulatory approvals and is expected to close by the first quarter of 2013,” the company said.

ACG, which is located in the South Caspian Sea about 95 km off the coast of Azerbaijan, is the largest oil and gas field complex in Azerbaijan and is one of the largest producing oil fields in the world.

BP operates ACG and is partnered by State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR), Chevron, Statoil, ExxonMobil, Inpex, Turkish NOC -TPAO and Itochu.

The average production from the field is around 7,00,000 barrels of oil a day.

The potential recovery from the field is estimated at over five billion barrels.

The 1,768-km BTC Pipeline is one of the main export routes for Caspian crude oil production with a capacity of around one million barrels of oil a day to the Ceyhan terminal in the Mediterranean Sea in South-East Turkey.

This acquisition would bring nine per cent additional proven reserves to OVL’s portfolio, the company said.

OVL, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and a unit of Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL), paid a signing amount of $600 million for a 10 per cent stake in Abu Dhabi National Oil Co's (ADNOC) 40-year Lower Zakum Concession, Offshore Abu Dhabi.

""The current production of this field is about 400,000 barrels of oil per day (20 million tonnes per annum) and Indian consortium's annual share shall be about 2 million tonnes,"" OVL said in a press statement.

The field is to achieve plateau target of 450,000 barrels of oil per day by 2025.

The contract for the concession was signed in Abu Dhabi last evening in presence of Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

This is the first time that Indian oil companies have taken part in an Abu Dhabi oil and gas concession.

The concession, which has a term of 40 years with an effective date of March 9, 2018, was signed by ONGC Group Chairman Shashi Shanker and ADNOC Group Chief Executive Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber.

""ADNOC is finalising the potential partners for the remaining 30 per cent of the available 40 per cent stake in the Lower Zakum Concession earmarked for international oil and gas companies,"" the statement said.

The deal ""will help India meet its growing demand for energy and refined products, create opportunities for ADNOC to increase its market share in a key growth market, and build a solid foundation as ADNOC explores potential international investments, particularly focused on downstream opportunities,"" Sultan al-Jaber said.

Shanker hoped that the historic agreement will lead to further opportunities for Indian oil and gas companies to participate in the UAE's energy sector.

""The agreement reflects the vision of the Prime Minister of India towards strengthening hydrocarbon linkages with the UAE on a win-win basis,"" he said.

ADNOC chief executive said the pact supports company's strategy to maximise economic value and recovery from its offshore oil and gas resources. ""This is an attractive and strategic agreement for both parties that will deliver competitive returns and long term growth opportunities.""

ADNOC had in August last year said that it would split its ADMA-OPCO offshore concession into three areas - Lower Zakum, Umm Shaif and Nasr, and Sateh Al Razboot and Umm Lulu - with new terms to unlock greater value and increase opportunities for partnerships.

""The present transaction marks entry of OVL in highly prospective UAE region and is consistent with its stated strategic objective of adding high quality producing assets to its existing oil and gas exploration and production portfolio,"" the statement said.

OVL is India's largest international oil and gas company, having 39 projects in 18 countries, including Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, Kazakhstan, Mozambique, Myanmar, Russia, South Sudan, Sudan, Namibia, Venezuela, Vietnam and New Zealand.

It currently produces about 277,000 barrels of oil and oil equivalent gas per day and has total oil and gas reserves (2P) of about 704 million tonnes of oil equivalent as on April 1, 2017.

ADNOC will have 60 per cent stake in the existing ADMA-OPCO concession, which produces around 700,000 barrels per day of oil and is projected to reach about 1 million barrels per day 2021.

ONGC Videsh's top official in trouble as junior alleges sexual harassment,ONGC Videsh's top official in trouble as junior alleges sexual harassment,"An employee of ONGC Videsh, the overseas investment arm of the government-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, has accused her immediate superior of sexual misconduct and harassment.

The 31-year-old in her complaint to the police has alleged inappropriate touching and unreasonable demands by the male colleague and says he burdened her with an excessive workload that was ruining her health.

The company has set up an internal committee to investigate the complaint. Speaking to Mail Today, the accused, Shashi Bhushan Singh, said he was unaware of the contents of the FIR, but admitted to having a complaint against him which the panel is probing. ""I have filed my detailed reply to the committee,"" he said, while expressing his inability to provide further information as he was travelling.

The woman, a company secretary in the Capital, has alleged that her senior would touch her inappropriately when she pulled out files from the almirah or the table. She said he would force her to work on his desktop and used the opportunity to leer at her. She also alleged that he would make her listen to obscene and personal conversations with his wife. ""When I tried to leave his cabin, he pointed his finger at me and instructed me to sit in his cabin, leaving me in an unbearable and uncomfortable situation,"" the complaint said.

A survey report on sexual harassment at workplace by the Indian National Bar Association that came out this year revealed that demands for sexual favours, inappropriate touches and lewd comments still continue to afflict offices in the country, with the national Capital being the most undesirable city for female workers. Of the 6,092 case studied in the survey, Delhi reported the highest number of victims, 63 percent, followed by Mumbai and Bengaluru. The findings also indicated that workplace harassment was the highest in the IT field, followed by the education, media and legal sectors.

Cops have booked Singh for sexual harassment and ""using word and gesture intended to insult the modesty of the woman"". The woman also claims that two days after she filed a sexual harassment complaint with the Delhi Commission for Women, National Commission for Scheduled Castes and ONGC's SC/ST employee welfare association, the company transferred her to a different department. When she sought answers, she was allegedly told that it was done on the directives of her senior.

""As a superior, the accused took advantage of his position and created an environment of terror, fear and humiliation in the office,"" she said in the complaint. ""This act of the authority discourages a woman to take any action in future against the wrongdoer in the organisation because she would get transferred and the accused would be in the same position.""

The woman told the police that Singh would call her 5-10 minutes before closing time because of which she often missed her office bus to go back home. ""My boss made me sit till 8pm without a reason and when I requested him to let me go home as it would be difficult to find conveyance, he would shout and often send me with some other male colleague,"" she alleged.

Not just this: the woman said the accused would make her stand in his cabin for hours without any reason. ""He would do as a silent punishment in situations where I had taken leave for personal reasons. He would threaten to make me work all night in the office and if I do not complete time-taking assignments within an hour or a day,"" said the victim.

The woman alleged that her senior's conduct had left a scar on her dignity and made it difficult for her to focus on her family responsibilities.

India has blamed Iran's flip-flop over the terms of the delay, while Tehran holds the Indian consortium's offer as ""unsatisfactory"".India had in March submitted a revised plan for developing the field, reducing the proposed investment to $3 billion from $4 billion. Iran, however, is still not satisfied.As reported by TOI, miffed with the delay, New Delhi has asked its refiners to reduce oil imports from Iran by a fifth.

Of this, 14 assets in 10 countries are producing and four in a similar number of countries are under development, he said.Verma said OVL's next incremental production will come from Columbia where it has made a significant discovery and from Iran where it is negotiating a contract for a gas field it had discovered.OVL plans to spend USD 1 billion in the current fiscal to drill new wells and add production facilities in fields from Russia to Venezuela The company has 633 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas reserves in its assets abroad.

OVL, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), had last year bought a 15 per cent stake in the field for $1.268 billion. It paid an additional $930 million for another 11 per cent stake.



The firm and its wholly-owned subsidiary ONGC Videsh Vankorneft Pte Ltd, Singapore ""jointly signed definitive agreements with Rosneft, the national oil company of Russia for acquiring additional 11 per cent shares in JSC Vankorneft, a company organized under the law of Russian Federation which is the owner of Vankor Field and North Vankor license"", the company said in a statement.



After the closing of the present transaction, OVL will raise its participation share in Vankorneft to 26 per cent.

Iran Expects Major Gas Deal With India in Sept.,Iran Expects Major Gas Deal With India in Sept.,"Iran and India are expected to sign a deal on developing Farzad-B Gas Field in the Persian Gulf by the end of next month after years of negotiations.

Ali Akbar Shabanpour, managing director of Pars Oil and Gas Company, made the statement after discussing the most sought-after gas project with a top delegation of ONGC Videsh Ltd—the overseas arm of India's state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation—in a meeting in Tehran this week, Shana reported.

""POGC and the Indian side have reached an understanding on technical and economic grounds over developing Farzad-B Gas Field. The two sides have agreed to continue the talks to sign an agreement by the end of September,"" he added.

An initial development plan calls for extracting 30 million cubic meters of natural gas per day from the field, but according to Shabanpour, ONGC Videsh has stipulated in its proposal that it will draw 56 million cubic meters of gas per day from the field.

""The two sides hold close views in terms of investment and financial issues, and made huge progress in negotiations,"" he said. A consortium of three Indian companies, namely ONGC, Oil India and the Indian Oil Corporation, discovered huge amounts of gas reserves in Iran's Farsi Block in 2008. The discovery in the Persian Gulf was later named Farzad-B.

However, Indians did not obtain the permission to develop the field after they were forced to abandon the project following the enforcement of tighter western financial and trade restrictions over Iran's nuclear dispute.

Gas output from the field can either be converted into liquefied natural gas by freezing at subzero temperature and shipping in cryogenic ships to India or transported through a pipeline passing either overland through Pakistan or subsea. Farzad-B is estimated to hold more than 500 billion cubic meters of in-place gas reserves, of which 370 billion cubic meters are recoverable.

Tortuous Talks

India has been pushing for the development rights of Farzad-B after Iran and the six world powers (the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany) reached an accord in July last year on temporarily limiting Tehran's nuclear program in exchange for some sanctions relief.

As a gesture of goodwill, Iran has excluded Farzad-B from a list of several dozen oil and gas projects that it plans to put out to tender under a new model of contracts, dubbed Iran Petroleum Contracts. In September, ONGC Videsh reportedly submitted a $10-billion proposal for developing the Farzad-B Gas Field and shipping the gas to India.

An official at the Iranian Offshore Oil Company also said in December that an initial agreement had been reached on developing the first phase of Farzad-B project under a $3-billion contract.",https://financialtribune.com/articles/energy/47945/iran-expects-major-gas-deal-with-india-in-sept,"As a gesture of goodwill, Iran has excluded Farzad-B Gas Field from a list

ONGC Videsh and Rosneft have closed the transaction of selling 15% shares in Vankorneft.

The Dollar Business Bureau

ONGC Videsh Ltd. (OVL) and Rosneft Oil Company have completed the acquisition of 15% shares in Vankorneft JSC, ONGC said in an announcement on Tuesday. In September last year, ONGC had signed a proposal to acquire 15% stake in Russia’s second biggest oil field of Vankorneft from Rosneft for $1.27 billion.

“The closed transaction is symbolic for both the companies and marks transition to a new level of cooperation in the Russian-Indian relations in the sphere of energy,” Rosneft said in a statement.

“ONGC gets substantial interest and relevant rights in one of the biggest large-scale projects of Rosneft of the last decade, whereas Rosneft retains major shares in the project and will operate on the field through the operator company RN-Vankor,” it added.

Rosneft Oil Company will hold the outstanding shares of around 85% of JSC Vankorneft as the field has recoverable capitals of 2.5 billion barrels and may give OVL 3.3 million tonnes per annum of oil production.

Rosneft has also agreed to sell another 11% stake in Vankor to OVL. The daily oil production of Vankor is nearly 442,000 barrels per day. It is the second largest field of Rosneft by production and accounts for 4% of Russia’s crude oil production. With the completion of this agreement, shares of daily oil production of OVL will be around 66,000 barrels per day.

This acquisition also strengthens OVL's presence in Russia, and it is consistent with the company’s strategic objective of bringing in high-quality international assets to its existing E&P portfolio.

This is the fourth largest achievement by OVL. In 2013, it had bought 16% stake in Mozambique's offshore Rovuma Area 1, which holds almost 75 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves, for $4.125 billion.",https://in.thedollarbusiness.com/news/ongc-closes-acquisition-of-15-stake-in-vankor/46782,"The Dollar Business Bureau ONGC Videsh Ltd.

Russia approves ONGC’s $1.3 bn deal for stake in second biggest oilfield,Russia approves ONGC’s $1.3 bn deal for stake in second biggest oilfield,"Follow us on ONGC Videsh Ltd will buy 15 pc in Vankor, Russia's second largest oilfield

New Delhi: The Russian government has given its go-ahead for ONGC Videsh Ltd.’s deal to buy 15 per cent in the country’s second biggest oil field of Vankor from Rosneft for USD 1.268 billion.

OVL, the overseas arm of the state explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), had in September last year signed an agreement to buy 15 per cent stake in Vankorneft, the developer of the Vankor oil and gas condensate field in Turukhansky district of Krasnoyak Territory in Russia.

""We have received approval of the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) for the deal,"" OVL Managing Director Narendra K Verma told PTI here.

With this, all approvals for the deal are in place and Rosneft now has to restructure Vankorneft by giving OVL board positions and carving out the Vankor fields into a separate company, all of which is expected to be completed by June.

This month, OVL signed an initial agreement to raise its stake in Vankor to 26 per cent from 15 per cent, while three other state companies -- Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Oil India Ltd (OIL) and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPLC) would together pick up 23.9 per cent.

""We are not very clear if the additional stake would also need FAS approval,"" he said adding the price for the additional stake is yet to be finalised.

Vankor is OVLs fourth biggest acquisition ever.

Vankorneft, a subsidiary of Rosneft, was founded in 2004 to carry out the project of the Vankor field development, the largest field to have been discovered and brought into production in Russia in the last 25 years.

It is located in the northern part of Eastern Siberia, in Turukhansky District of Krasnoyarsk Territory, 142 km from Igarka.

As of January 1, 2015, the initial recoverable reserves in the Vankor field are estimated at 476 million tonnes of oil and condensate, and 173 billion cubic meters of gas. The area of the Vankor field is 447 square kilometers. Oil and gas condensate production in 2015 was 22 million tons.

The 15 per cent stake will give OVL 3.3 million tonnes per annum of oil production.

Prior to the deal, Rosneft, Russias national oil company, held 100 per cent stake in Vankorneft.

This will be the fourth biggest acquisition by OVL. It had in 2013 paid USD 4.125 billion for a 16 per cent stake in Mozambiques offshore Rovuma Area 1, which holds as much as 75 Trillion cubic feet of gas reserves.

In 2009, it had bought Russia-focused Imperial Energy for USD 2.1 billion. Prior to that, it had in 2001 paid USD 1.7 billion for a 20 per cent interest in the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas field off Russias far eastern coast.

Vankor is Rosnefts (and Russias) second largest field by production and accounts for 4 per cent of Russian production. The daily production from the field is around 442,000 barrels per day of crude oil on an average with OVLs share of daily oil production at about 66,000.

Upon completion of the deal, OVL will have two seats on the board of Vankorneft, Rosneft said.

Indian oil giants sign energy deals with Russia's Rosneft,Indian oil giants sign energy deals with Russia's Rosneft,"India's public sector oil companies led by Oil and Natural Gas Corporation's (ONGC) foreign arm ONGC Videsh Limited (OVL) on Wednesday inked pacts to buy stakes in two lucrative Russian oilfields in Siberia for an estimated $4.2 billion (around Rs 28,253 crore).

Russia's national oil company Rosneft, which needs to pay off debts incurred in its $55-billion acquisition of TNK-BP in 2013, is selling almost half of its most promising assets to Indian firms in the deal.

Under the agreements, OVL will increase its stake in Rosneft's Vankor project to 26 per cent while Oil India Limited (Oil), Indian Oil Limited (IOL) and Bharat Petroresources will buy up to 23.9 percent between them in the same field.

Vankor has recoverable reserves of 2.5 billion barrels. Indian public sector oil companies are expected to get access to about 12 million tonnes of oil a year once they complete acquisition of the 49.9-per cent stake of Rosneft, the world's top listed oil producer by output.

The agreements were signed in the presence of petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan on the second day of Rosneft chief executive officer Igor Sechin's two-day visit to India.

Once the deals go through, Rosneft will retain 50.1-per cent stake in Vankor while Indian companies will hold 49.9 per cent. Acquisition is subject to relevant Board, government and regulatory approvals and expected to close by September 2016.

Western sanctions imposed on Russia following the trouble in Ukraine and annexation of the Crimean peninsula have hurt the country's economy and companies like Rosneft are facing problems in marketing their oil and gas.

The deals signed on Wednesday will also give Russian oil companies access to the fast growing Indian market.

Rosneft holds 80 per cent shares while BP PLC (UK) holds 20 per cent in TYNGD through their respective subsidiaries. TYNGD produced 20,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd) with expected peak production of 100,000 bopd by 2021.

Oil, IOL and a subsidiary of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited signed a sale purchase agreement for 29.9-per cent stake in Tass-Yuriakh oilfield from for $1.28 billion, top officials said. The consortium also signed heads of agreement with Rosneft for taking 23.9-per cent stake in Vankor oilfield for just more than $2 billion. Simultaneously, OVL, which had in September last year bought 15 per cent in the Vankor for $1.26 billion, signed an MoU to increase its stake in the Siberian oilf ield to 26 per cent by paying an additional $925 million. The IOC-led consortium also signed another MoU with Rosneft for exploring taking stake in development of Vankor cluster fields of Suzunskoye, Tagulskoye and Lodochnoye.

Sechin told the media that the pacts will allow Indian partners to participate in Russian upstream sector and also open the growing Indian market to Rosneft. While the IOC-OILBharat PetroResources deal for 29.9 per cent stake in Tass-Yuriakh oilfield is a concluded agreement, the consortium's Vankor deal is an initial pact and a salepurchase agreement is yet to be concluded. Similarly, OVL's increase in stake in Vankor too is yet to be concluded.

Taas-Yuriah oilfield, which holds recoverable reserves of 137 million tonnes, produces 20,000 bpd. The output is slated to rise to 100,000 bpd in two years, officials said.",https://www.businesstoday.in/industry/energy/story/indian-oil-giants-sign-energy-deals-with-russia-s-rosneft-58206-2016-03-17,"India €s public sector oil companies led by Oil and Natural Gas

OVL not to exit Vietnam block despite poor prospects,OVL not to exit Vietnam block despite poor prospects,"ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of state explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, has decided not to exit a Vietnam oil block in the contested waters of the South China Sea despite poor hydrocarbon prospectivity.

OVL has decided to seek a third extension of exploration licence for Block 128 to maintain India's strategic interest in the South China Sea, a top official said. The block lies in the part of South China Sea over which China claims sovereignty. In 2011, Beijing had warned OVL that its exploration activities off the Vietnam coast were illegal and violated China's sovereignty, but the company continued exploring for oil and gas.

OVL has not found any hydrocarbons in the block but will continue operations in line with India's strategic and diplomatic interest in the region, he said. The extended exploration licence for Block 128 is due expire this month and the company is seeking an extension. OVL reckons that if it was to exit the block, it would have to pay $15-20 million penalty for not drilling a committed exploration well. By continuing with the block, it is not just saving on the penalty but also helping New Delhi maintain its strategic interest in the region, he said. The renewal is being seen as India's attempt to assert its presence in the region. OVL forayed into Vietnam as early as 1988, when it bagged the exploration licence for Block 06.1.

The company got two exploration blocks - Block 127 and Block 128, in 2006. However, Block 127 was relinquished after completing the work programme, but the other Block 128 continued to be retained. It first took a two year extension of the exploration period till June 2014 and then another one year. The official said the first extension followed China putting the area under Block 128 for global bidding. OVL holds 100 per cent interest in Block 128 and has so far invested $46 million in the block. The official said like in case of Block 127, OVL had wanted to exit the adjacent Block 128 because of poor prospectivity. But decided to stay put because of India's strategic interests in the region.

China claims sovereignty over most of the South China Sea where Block 127 and 128 are located and had warned the Indian arm from drilling in the region. OVL continues to own 45 per cent in Vietnam's offshore block 6.1 and its share of production was 2.023 billion cubic metres of gas and 0.036 million tonnes of condensate.

Oil and gas output from ONGC Videsh in 2012-13 will be less than last fiscal year’s 8.7 million tonnes, its managing director said on Monday.

Output from a south Sudan field has been halted over disputes, while production from Syrian fields has declined, DK Sarraf said.

State-run explorer ONGC invests in foreign assets through its unit ONGC Videsh.

“Production in north Sudan is almost normal, but south Sudan will take some months,” Sarraf said. “Other than Sudan and Syria, we would try to catch up the production (from other fields) at last year’s level, but some fields are also declining.”

He hoped that output from overseas assets could get a boost from the next fiscal year as new fields in A1 and A3 in Myanmar would be commissioned.

India, the world’s fourth-biggest oil importer, buys nearly 80 percent of its oil needs as expanding refining capacity has outpaced local oil output. ONGC’s local oil output has been almost stagnant for years.

OVL to buy Anadarko stake in Mozambique field for $2.6bn,OVL to buy Anadarko stake in Mozambique field for $2.6bn,"ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) is likely to buy US energy major Anadarko Corp’s 10 percent stake in a giant Mozambique gas field for $2.6 billion this week, the fourth acquisition by the state-owned firm in a year.

New Delhi: ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) is likely to buy US energy major Anadarko Corp’s 10 percent stake in a giant Mozambique gas field for $2.6 billion this week, the fourth acquisition by the state-owned firm in a year.

OVL, which under DK Sarraf has transformed from a timid firm into an aggressor that stitched over $11 billion worth of deals since September last year, is likely to announce in a day or two the deal to buy Anadarko’s 10 per cent stake in Mozambique’s offshore Rovuma Area 1, sources said.

The company had on June 25 announced buying Videocon’s 10 per cent stake in the same field, which may hold as much as 65 Trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of gas resources, along with Oil India Ltd (OIL) for $2.475 billion.

Sources said unlike the June deal, OVL, the overseas arm of Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), will buy Anadarko’s stake alone in what will be India’s second biggest overseas energy acquisition ever.

OVL, which had gone into a shell after the January 2009 acquisition of Russia-focused Imperial Energy plc for $2.1 billion, has turned a new leaf after Sarraf took over as Managing Director in September 2011.

The Imperial deal had faced lot of criticism, including from CAG, as oil production lagged the projections made by the company’s former owners. It took Sarraf almost a year to lift sagging morale of employees who were unwilling to take decisions for the fear of facing flak later.

Sources said the company is now transformed into an aggressor and is even looking to scuttle a large Chinese deal in Brazil.

The company, which since inception had invested USD 17 billion in 32 assets in 15 countries till 2011, has struck over $11 billion worth deals in the past one year.

With under 8 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent output from its overseas assets, OVL currently makes up for 15 per cent of ONGC Group production of 60 million tonnes.

As per ONGC’s vision document, OVL’s share is to rise to 60 million tonnes by 2030 when ONGC Group’s output would be 130 million (domestic production rising from 52 million tonnes currently to 70 million tonnes).

New Zealand launched the bidding round in April, offering five offshore and three onshore release areas.

""OVL submitted bid for one exploration block located in Taranaki offshore basin in October 2014,"" the company said in a statement issued on Wednesday.

Others who walked away with exploration licenses included US giant Chevron and Norwegian state-owned oil and gas company Statoil.

OMV New Zealand, a subsidiary of Austrian oil major OMV and already producing oil and gas offshore Taranaki, was awarded another offshore Taranaki and one Pegasus permit.

OVL has taken a 12-year permit in the Taranaki Basin.

The exploration permit has been awarded to OVL by Simon Bridges, Minister of Energy and Resources, Government of New Zealand at a formal ceremony held at Wellington on Tuesday.

""The award of block signifies entry of ONGC Videsh into a new country, taking its presence in 17 countries in 36 projects,"" the statement said.

OVL Managing Director and CEO Narendra K Verma said the firm's ""maiden entry into the hydrocarbon province of Taranaki offshore basin in New Zealand shall provide an opportunity to explore interesting hydrocarbon potential in the region and act as a foothold for greater participation in the far-east region.""

With this, OVL now has 36 projects in 17 countries, including Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Libya, Mozambique, Myanmar, Russia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela, Vietnam and New Zealand.

It currently produces 160,000 barrels of oil and oil equivalent gas per day and has total oil and gas reserves of about 637 million tonnes oil equivalent as on March 31, 2014.

OVL produced 8.36 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas in 2013-14 fiscal, up from 7.26 million tonnes oil equivalent in the previous year.

It recently acquired 2.7 per cent stake in an Azerbaijan oilfield that produces about 700,000 barrels of oil per day.

Also, it picked up 16 per cent interest in a giant gas discovery area in Mozambique. The offshore gas discovery has recoverable reserves of 50-70 trillion cubic feet, out of which OVL's share would be 8-11 Tcf.

ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of state explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), and Oil India Ltd (OIL) have already spent $5 billion in taking 20 per cent stake in Area-1 gas field.

Their share of investment for developing the offshore gas field and converting the fuel into LNG for export in ships would be another $3 billion-plus.

Though the required law and investment agreements are in place for the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) for the upstream component, the special regimes required for midstream and downstream investment (pipelines and LNG plants) are yet to be finalised, sources privy to the development said.

The special regimes for midstream and downstream investment require passing of a decree law and an LNG investment agreement with the approval of the Parliament of Mozambique. While the Mozambique cabinet has approved the decree law, it is awaiting Parliament nod, sources said.

Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Friday pressed visting Mozambique Foreign Minister Oldemiro Julio Marques Baloi for early passage of the law.

Any delay in the Parliament nod will push back the project as Mozambique is headed for general elections and a new Parliament may take sometime to constitute and approve the decree.

This, they said, may result in erosion in the value of project. Sources said OVL and partners are targeting 2019 for start of gas production. An official statement said Pradhan and the visiting minister discussed various areas of mutual cooperation in the energy sector.

Pradhan said both countries have traditional links which have grown from strength to strength over the years, it said.

During the meeting, an MoU was signed between India and Mozambique on cooperation in the field of oil and gas for five years. The objective of the MoU is to enhance bilateral cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, the statement said. US energy firm Anadarko Petroleum Corp is the operator of Area-1 or Rovuma-1 project.

"ONGC net profit rises 19% to Rs 4,782 cr","ONGC net profit rises 19% to Rs 4,782 cr","State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp on Wednesday reported a 19 per cent rise in net profit for the April-June quarter on realising higher crude oil prices.

Net profit of Rs 4,782 crore was 19.07 per cent higher in the first quarter of 2014-15 than Rs 4,016 crore logged in the year-ago period, ONGC said in a statement in New Delhi.

ONGC, which had almost flat crude oil production in Q1, had a net realisation of $47.51 per barrel as compared to $40.33 a barrel in Q1, 2013-14.

This was despite the subsidy outgo rising 4 per cent to Rs 13,200 crore.

Upstream oil producers such as ONGC have to bear a portion of the losses that fuel retailers make on selling diesel, domestic LPG and kerosene at government controlled rates. This they do by extending discounts on crude oil they sell to retailers.

Exploration-related write-offs during the quarter, on account of dry wells, more-than-doubled to Rs 3,828 crore.

ONGC said its gross realisation was $109.48 per barrel in Q1, up 6.23 per cent from $103.06 in April-June 2013.

After paying for fuel subsidy, it got $47.51 a barrel. The subsidy discount was $62.33 per barrel in Q1 as compared to $62.73 last year.

The company said its net profit should have been higher by Rs 7,396 crore but for this subsidy discount.

ONGC said its crude oil production was almost flat at 5.1 million tons while gas output dipped 2.11 per cent to 5.775 billion cubic meters.

Sales rose 13.12 per cent to Rs 21,813 crore.

The company made six new oil and gas fields in western offshore and KG basin.

ONGC said it sold the first cargo of around 1.2 million barrels of crude oil from its Carabobo project in Venezuela to Reliance Industries' Jamnagar refinery. The cargo arrived at Jamnagar on July 7, the statement said.

""The crude was shipped by Bunga Kasturi Dua (vessel) from Venezuelan port to Sikkar, Gujarat in approximately 40 days,"" it said.

ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of the state explorer, hold 11 per cent interest in the Carabobo project. Oil India Ltd and Indian Oil Corp (IOC) hold 3.5 per cent stake each in the project while Spain's Repsol has 11 per cent interest.

Subsidiary companies bring cheer to ONGC,Subsidiary companies bring cheer to ONGC,"Upstream oil giant ONGC is flying high on the back of better performances of its subsidiary companies - ONGC Videsh and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL). Chairman Dinesh K. Sarraf announced the financial results of both the companies on Tuesday.

ONGC Videsh (OVL), the foreign arm of upstream public sector oil giant ONGC, has recorded its highest- ever profit of Rs 4,445 crore - an increase of 13.1 per cent from the previous year.

Crude oil production during the financial year 2014 (FY14) was higher by 26.3 per cent due to new production stream from ACG, Azerbaijan, acquisition of additional 12 per cent PI in Block BC-10, Brazil, and higher production from Sudan and resumption of production from South Sudan. Gross Revenue during FY14 has increased mainly due to increase in production and positive exchange rate.

Sarraf said the ONGC Videsh team had done an excellent job in achieving the higher physical and financial performance and successful acquisitions of discovered oil and gas projects.

ONGC Videsh has participated in 33 projects in 16 countries, including Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Libya, Mozambique, Myanmar, Russia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela and Vietnam.

MRPL, a unit of stateowned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), reported a net profit of Rs 1,067 crore in the fourth quarter on the back of foreign exchange and inventory gains.

MRPL had posted a net loss of Rs 62 crore in January- March 2013.

Sarraf said the company has done well on the back of Rs 575 crore gain from rupee appreciating against the US dollar and an inventory gain of Rs 503 crore.

MRPL earned $ 3.18 on turning every barrel of crude oil into fuel as compared to a gross refining margin of $ 1.98 a barrel.

Sarraf further said, "" Going forward, GRMs (gross refining margins) are going to be higher because completion of the phase- III expansion plan which will enable the refinery to distil heavy crudes which are cheaper.'' Turnover rose by about three per cent to Rs 20,032 crore, he said, adding the refinery processed 3.84 million tonnes in January- March, down from 4.12 million tonnes a year ago. For full fiscal 2013- 14, the company earned a net profit of Rs 601 crore as opposed to a loss of Rs 179 crore.

Turnover was up 9.3 per cent at Rs 75,226 crore as export revenue rose 6.15 per cent to Rs 35,392 crore.

N K Verma is new ONGC Videsh Managing Director,N K Verma is new ONGC Videsh Managing Director,"New Delhi: Narendra Kumar Verma was selected to head ONGC Videsh Ltd, India's flagship overseas oil and gas assets acquisition firm. Verma, 55, is currently Director for Exploration in OVL's parent company, Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC).

The Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB), which is the government head-hunter, interviewed seven candidates for the post, which fell vacant after Dinesh K Sarraf was elevated as Chairman and Managing Director of ONGC.

""PESB recommended the following name for the post of Managing Director, ONGC Videsh Limited (OVL): N K Verma,"" it said in a posting after interviews.

OVL has interests in 33 oil and gas assets in 17 countries and contributes to 12 per cent and 7 per cent of India's oil and natural gas production, respectively. In terms of reserves and production, OVL is the second-largest petroleum company of India, next only to parent ONGC.

Originally, 15 candidates, including ONGC Director (Technology & Field Services) Shashi Shanker and OVL Director (Finance) and acting Managing Director Satpal Garg, had applied for the position. Shanker did not appear for the interview. At 53 years, he is the youngest director on the ONGC board and is widely tipped to succeed Sarraf when he superannuates on September 30, 2017. He has been on the ONGC board since December 2012.

PESB said besides Verma and Garg, it interviewed ONGC executives Vikas Tayal, S K Moitra and A Balachandran as well as Indian Oil Corp (IOC) executive director Rajiv Khanna and IAS officer V Srinivas. Garg has been director finance of OVL since September 2008 and is due to superannuate on August 31, 2016.

Verma who will superannuate in January 2019, will also be eligible for the job of ONGC Chairman and Managing Director upon Sarraf's retirement. Incidentally, Sarraf also used the OVL route to the top post in ONGC. He was Director (Finance) in ONGC before he went on to head OVL.

Sources said D Rajkumar, Managing Director & CEO, Bharat PetroResources Ltd (BPRL), was shortlisted for an interview but chose not to attend. BPRL is the upstream subsidiary of Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and has been at the forefront of acquisitions in Mozambique and other countries.

After OVL, BRPL has the largest portfolio of overseas oil and gas assets. It owns interests in eight exploration blocks in Brazil and one each in Indonesia, Australia and East Timor. It also has a 10 per cent interest in a giant gas field off Mozambique that is estimated to hold up to 70 trillion cubic feet of in place reserves.",https://www.deccanchronicle.com/140521/business-companies/article/n-k-verma-new-ongc-videsh-managing-director,"New Delhi: Narendra Kumar Verma was selected to head ONGC Videsh Ltd,

ONGC Videsh to get stake in Myanmar oil and gas block,ONGC Videsh to get stake in Myanmar oil and gas block,"Despite losing out in competitive bidding, ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL), the overseas arm of state explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp, may still get a stake in a deep-sea block in Myanmar.

OVL had bid for two of the 10 shallow-water blocks that Myanmar had auctioned in December but drew a blank when the fields were awarded on March 26.

""We had a pre-bid understanding with an international oil company that if we were to win any shallow-water acreage, they will farm-in (pick up stake). Similarly, in case that company was successful in picking up any of the deep-sea acreages it bid for, we would get a stake,"" OVL Managing Director S P Garg said.

Garg refused to identify the company and said OVL could get up to 49 per cent in the deep-water oil and gas block won by the international company.

London-based Ophir Energy plc and Total of France each won a deep-sea block in Myanmar's maiden licensing round.

While Ophir won the AD-3 deep-water block, Total won the YWB block. Italy's Eni picked up deep-water blocks MD-2 and MD-4 on its own.

The other deep-sea blocks went to groups of global energy majors and it is unlikely that OVL had a pre-bid understanding with them.

Anglo-Dutch supermajor Royal Dutch Shell was awarded deep-water blocks AD-9, AD-11 and MD-5 as operator, all alongside Japan's Mitsui Oil Exploration, according to Myanmar's Ministry of Energy.

US giant ConocoPhillips won deep-water block AD-10 with Norwegian state-owned Statoil as operator.

Reliance Industries won two of the three offshore oil and gas blocks it bid for while Oil India Ltd, along with partners Mercator Petroleum Ltd and Oilmax Energy Pvt Ltd, won two of the three blocks it bid for.

RIL won shallow-water blocks M-17 and M-18 while OIL and its partners got blocks M-4 and YEB, according to Myanmar's Ministry of Energy.

State-owned gas utility GAIL had bid for three blocks but like OVL, it drew a blank.

Cairn India, which was among the 61 firms pre-qualified to bid for 11 shallow-water and 19 deep-water blocks in an international tender, did not bid by the December deadline.

Three shallow-water blocks were offered in the Rakhine Offshore Area, three in the Moattama Offshore Area and five in the Tanintharyi Offshore Area. Only 10 shallow-water blocks were awarded.

A total of 19 deep-water blocks were offered in these areas and bids were received for only 10.

RIL's M-17 and M-18 blocks in Myanmar are located in the Moattama basin in water depths of up to 3,000 feet and together cover an area of 27,600 square kilometres.

According to the Myanmar ministry, BG will get two shallow-water and two deep-sea blocks, half of them as operator.

In the shallow-water category, US supermajor Chevron picked up block A-5, while Berlanga Holdings picked up block M-8, ROC oil block M-7, and Transcontinental Group block M-15.

ONGC Videsh strikes $2.6 billion Mozambique deal,ONGC Videsh strikes $2.6 billion Mozambique deal,"India's state-owned ONGC Videsh has become the latest Asian company to strike a deal in the resource-rich East African region.



ONGC Videsh, the subsidiary that handles the offshore operations for Oil & Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) on Monday agreed to buy a 10% stake in a Mozambique gas field from New York-listed Anadarko Petroleum Corp for a cash price of $2.64 billion.



Asian companies have been competing to secure equity stakes in liquified natural gas (LNG) fields and, according to a person close to the situation, much of this will be sold into Asia, to offer a cheaper alternative to Australia's LNG. As a result, prices have been creeping up.



In June, Oil India and ONGC Videsh jointly agreed to buy a 10% stake in the same field for $2.47 billion from Videocon. Earlier this year, CNPC acquired Eni's block in an adjacent field for $4.2 billion. Last year, Thai company PTTEP bought Cove Energy, which held an 8.5% stake in the Mozambique field for $1.79 billion.



""There has been a heck of activity from this field in Mozambique -- it has driven a lot of the M&A activity,"" said one person close to the situation. ""We expect the chase for LNG to continue -- as Asian companies want to secure equity and diversify their sources of LNG geographically,"" the person added.



The deal is struck at an interesting time for India. The Indian rupee has been rapidly depreciating and the government has been trying to rein in capital outflows. Earlier this month, it limited the foreign direct investments of Indian companies at 100% of their net worth, down from 400% previously. Companies that want to make foreign investments in excess of 100% of their net worth require approvals to do so.

Indian outbound M&A -- which has chalked up $8.5 billion of announced deals this year -- has largely been in the shadow of Chinese outbound M&A, which has amounted to $38.6 billion.



Clearly, however, securing energy remains a priority for the Indian government and its central bank exempted both state-owned oil companies - ONGC Videsh and Oil India - from the limits on foreign investment.

ONGC Videsh has big ambitions to grow its oil and gas production capacity overseas and it is expected to continue to be acquisitive. “ONGC Videsh produced 7.26 million tons of oil and gas during the fiscal year ended March 2013,” said DK Sarraf, managing director and chief executive of ONGC Videsh in an interview with FinanceAsia last week. “We plan to increase production to 20 million tons of oil and gas within the next five years and to 60 million tons by 2030,” he added.



Bank of America Merrill Lynch advised ONGC Videsh while Citi was the sellside advisor for Anadarko. The transaction is expected to close around the end of 2013, subject to government approvals.",https://www.financeasia.com/article/ongc-videsh-strikes-2-6-billion-mozambique-deal/354746,"Asian companies compete to secure equity stakes in liquified natural gas in

The Oil And Natural Gas Corporation : Fueling India's Economic Growth,The Oil And Natural Gas Corporation : Fueling India's Economic Growth,"ONGC – An Overview

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC) was founded by the Government of India on 14th August 1956. ONGC is an Indian multinational oil and natural gas company, headquartered in Dehradun and is currently one of the largest oil and natural gas exploration companies in Asia. Keeping in mind that crude oil is on the top of the import bill of India, ONGC is responsible for meeting almost 30% of the country’s demand for crude oil and 48% of the country’s natural gas requirements.

ONGC Videsh Limited (OVL), a subsidiary completely owned by ONGC is vested with the responsibility of prospecting and exploring hydrocarbon resources abroad. Currently, OVL is involved in projects in 15 countries. As per 31st March, 2013 data, OVL achieved an authorized and paid up share capital amounting to Rs 5,000 crore.

ONGC in Action

The basic responsibility of ONGC is prospecting for natural hydrocarbon resources, exploring them and tapping the potential reserves of hydrocarbon into commercially viable energy sources. The achievements of ONGC in the last five decades is extremely appreciable, as evident from the fact that 6 out of the 7 Indian Basins producing commercially viable fuel has been discovered by ONGC. The Company is involved in exploring and tapping the hydrocarbon resources of the 26 sedimentary basins and the relentless efforts of ONGC has resulted in the addition of 7.1 billion tons of ‘In-place Oil and Gas’ volumes in the last five decades.

A current possessor of 69.23% equity stake, ONGC also has 11,000 kilometers of pipelines under its sleeve in India. During global oil supply dry up periods ONGC has invested exhaustively in various ‘Improved Oil Recovery (IOR)’ and ‘Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR)’ programs (enhancing the ‘Recovery Factor’ to 33.5% in 2011) in addition to supply from its various ‘brownfields’ namely Mumbai High. The continuous efforts of ONGC have considerably helped to maintain a greater than one ‘Reserve Replenishment Ratio’.

ONGC has always been proactive in trying to meet the ever increasing domestic requirements of fuel. The final agreement of securing a 10% stake in the strategically located offshore gas fields in Mozambique by paying US based Andarko Petroleum $6.2 billion as a price for the 10% stake is just another example and the second such deal to be finalized by ONGC in the recent months. According to Sudhir Vasudeva, Chairman, OVL, “Mozambique gas field has the potential to become one of the world’s largest LNG projects”.

So far ONGC’s biggest official overseas acquisition had been with ConocoPhillips. The deal involved in securing an 8.4% stake in the Kashagan project of Kazakhstan for US$ 5 billion in 2012. But sadly enough, the deal fell through because the Kazakhstan Government blocked the agreement and resold the stake to a Chinese firm. OVL has lost at least US$ 12.5 billion worth of deals to the Chinese and the current complications created by the Chinese firm Sinopec at the Brazilian oil fields is forcing ONGC to mull over exercising its preemption rights to block Sinochem group of China from buying a 35% stake in the Brazilian oilfields for US$ 1.54 billion. Another important foreign acquisition of ONGC in collaboration with OIL India was to buy a 10% stake from the Videocon Group in the Rovuma Area 1 field in Mozambique for US$ 2.48 billion.

So far the state run Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) had been involved in revamping and maintaining the 33 existing onshore drilling rigs of ONGC and is also involved in servicing and upgrading seven more rigs of ONGC which are on the verge of completion. However, BHEL is going to play a more important role in the oil drilling infrastructure after the finalization of the Rs 774 crore contract with ONGC to manufacture and supply six extremely high technology onshore oil drilling rigs to ONGC. These state of the art, 2000 HP, onshore drilling rigs with AC drives will be assembled in two phases. The Hyderabad plant of BHEL will handle the manufacture of the mechanical parts while the Bhopal plant will deal with the manufacture of the electrical components. As per a press release from BHEL, BHEL has a dedicated group of experts for manufacturing, refurbishment, and up-gradation of onshore drilling rigs and rig equipment along with adequate facilities. It is to be mentioned that BHEL is the only company in our country that manufactures onshore drilling rigs, having manufactured 71 rigs for ONGC and 13 for Oil India Limited (OIL) in the past.

In an effort to lower the infrastructural cost involved in explorations and further enhancement of field development, ONGC is planning to share the infrastructure of the Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) on the East Coast. Following this decision ONGC has signed an initial agreement with RIL. According to a statement released on behalf of RIL, “The memorandum of understanding (MoU) aims at working out the modalities for sharing of infrastructure, identifying additional requirements as well as firming up the commercial terms. The infrastructure sharing would help in early monetization of its deep water fields adjacent to the fields of RIL. The companies intend to enter into a formal agreement after conducting a joint study which will be spread over the next nine months”. The first phase of ONGC’s plans involves production of gas (6 to 9 standard cubic million per day) from the G-4, KG-DWN- D & E fields.

A Crude Oil Sale Agreement (COSA) has been signed between ONGC and one of its subsidiaries, Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited (MRPL) for the first time, ensuring a supply of crude oil from the JNTP/JD and offshore rig over a period of five years. The quantity of crude oil to be supplied over the period of five years is estimated to be worth Rs 38,500 crore given the fact that ONGC already supplies about 12% of MRPL’s crude oil requirement. This COSA completes ONGC’s deals with all the major domestic buyers of crude oil including BPCL, HPCL, IOCL and CPCL all of whom have signed COSA’s with ONGC.

In an effort to increase funding in ONGC’s explorations, the Cabinet has decided to double the natural gas prices from US$ 4.20 to US$ 8.4 per million British thermal unit. The logic behind the price hike is that domestic explorations in the long run will ultimately reduce the hefty import bill of crude oil for India.

As our country’s economy continues to grow, the fuel requirement is also growing almost proportionally. We should be thankful that organizations like ONGC are trying to acquire overseas assets to ensure a consistent supply to reduce the hefty crude oil import bill of Asia’s third largest economy.",https://www.mapsofindia.com/my-india/government/the-oil-and-natural-gas-corporation-fueling-indias-economic-growth,"Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC) was founded by the

ONGC to Buy $2.64 Billion Stake in Mozambique LNG,ONGC to Buy $2.64 Billion Stake in Mozambique LNG,"Aug. 26 (Bloomberg) — ONGC Videsh Ltd., a unit of India’s biggest energy explorer Oil & Natural Gas Corp., agreed to pay $2.64 billion to buy a 10 percent stake in a Mozambique gas field from Anadarko Petroleum Corp.

The liquefied natural gas project “is strategically located to supply LNG to India at a competitive price,” New Delhi-based ONGC said today in statement on its website.

The acquisition, subject to approvals in Mozambique and India, will add to ONGC’s interest in the Rovuma Area 1 field, after it joined with Oil India Ltd. in June to buy a 10 percent stake for $2.5 billion from Videocon Industries Ltd. ONGC plans to spend 11 trillion rupees ($172 billion) by 2030 to add reserves in India and overseas and reverse a decline in output from aging fields at home.

“As a result of both transactions, OVL will own a significant interest in this strategic project in Mozambique,” ONGC’s unit said in the statement. “Area 1 has potential to become one of the world’s largest LNG projects and today’s acquisition marks a further significant step by OVL/ONGC group towards the energy security of our country.”

ONGC rose 2.6 percent to close at 276.70 rupees in Mumbai on Aug. 23, bringing gains this year to 3.3 percent. Anadarko gained 0.6 percent on Aug. 23, taking its gain for the year to 21 percent.

Anadarko, which will remain the operator of Area 1 with a 26.5 percent stake, said the deal “values our pre-transaction interest at more than $9.6 billion,” according to a separate statement from The Woodlands, Texas, based company. The company will use cash from the sale to boost development at its U.S. onshore projects as well as the Gulf of Mexico, according to the statement.

Leading Efforts

Anadarko and Eni SpA have been leading efforts to convert gas from the Indian Ocean fields in Mozambique to liquid and transport it to countries including India via tankers. Liquefied natural gas plants need billions of dollars in investment to chill the gas to a liquid and ship it using tankers. The East African country has become a prominent destination for energy investment, especially by Asian companies, as it looks to develop the largest natural-gas discovery in a decade.

At a planned capacity of 20 million tons annually, the Mozambique project could be the world’s largest LNG export site after Ras Laffan in Qatar, where Exxon Mobil Corp. is a partner.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch was the financial adviser to ONGC.

Spending Needed

The scale of the reserves means significant spending by the blocks’ owners will be needed to construct export infrastructure. Building the necessary rigs, pipelines and export terminals could require $50 billion in investment, Mozambique’s mining minister said last year.

The east African country, with a per capita gross domestic product lower than that of Rwanda, has limited experience managing large-scale resource projects and is still building key ports and railway links. Rio Tinto Group earlier this year wrote down 70 percent of its investment in Mozambique’s coal sector because of insufficient transport capacity and a drop in coal prices.

ONGC Mittal Energy Ltd. (OMEL), a joint venture between ONGC Videsh Ltd. (OVL) and Mittal Investment Sarl (MIS), has acquired 30% Participating Interest (PI) in an exploratory Block 11-12, Offshore Turkmenistan in the Caspian Sea. Covering an area of 5663 square km, the block is located close to discovered and producing fields, and contains a number of prospects with significant reserve potential. Discoveries have been made in adjoining areas such as Ashrafi and Karabakh.

The block was earlier awarded by the Government of Turkmenistan to Maersk Oil, in December, 2002. The consortium now comprises of OMEL with 30% Participating Interest (PI); Wintershall, a German company with 34% PI and Maersk Oil, a Denmark company with 36% PI. Earlier, Wintershall and Maersk had acquired seismic data and drilled one exploratory well in the block. The well had provided indications of hydrocarbons. Another well is planned to be drilled by the new consortium during 2008.



Turkmenistan block is the fourth asset of OMEL. OMEL had earlier acquired interest in a producing asset in Syria, currently producing about 130,000 barrels per day of oil. OMEL was also awarded two highly prospective blocks in Nigerian deepwater  OPL 279, in which OMEL has 40% PI and OPL 285 in which OMEL has 60% PI; other partners being TOTAL, the French oil major and EMO, a local Nigerian company. OMEL is pursuing hydrocarbon assets in certain other countries also, some of which are in an advanced stage of negotiations. OMEL's constituent Mittal Investment Sarl (MIS) is owned by Steel baron Mr. L N Mittal.

ONGC Videsh's overseas woes: Could the problems have been avoided?,ONGC Videsh's overseas woes: Could the problems have been avoided?,"India's overseas oil and gas exploration has been floundering for a while. The latest in the litany of troubles involves the biggest player, ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL), which has 30 assets in 15 countries. OVL is mired in a dispute over a block in the South China Sea where China claims territorial rights over blocks originally allocated by Vietnamese oil company PetroVietnam. In May OVL withdrew from the block , saying it was unviable. Then China put the block up for bidding, and now, under diplomatic pressure from government, OVL has done an about turn, saying it will hold on to the block for two years, thereby creating a stalemate.Perhaps the sole ray of hope among the country's major oil companies is Bharat PetroResources Limited (BPRL), the exploration arm of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL). In June, BPRL announced it had found gas in Mozambique's Rovuma basin, in which it has a 10 per cent stake - a discovery that nearly doubled the block's recoverable gas potential to 60 trillion cubic feet.While other companies are stymied by political and diplomatic conflict, BPRL has good prospects in most of the 16 international blocks where it has invested since it was allowed to do so in 2006. Managing Director D. Rajkumar says: ""We too had options to get into countries like Libya, Sudan and other troubled waters, but we stayed away."" ""It was a combination of in-depth thinking and luck,"" says R.K. Singh, Chairman of BPCL and BPRL. ""Now, we are not buying assets but will reap what we have sown in the last six years."" The only asset about which BPRL is relatively less hopeful is in the United Kingdom, he adds.But BPRL is an exception, while OVL's South China Sea mess is the tip of the iceberg. At least 14 other assets belonging to OVL and other public sector units are affected by turmoil in Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Syria, and the tensions between Iran and the United States. Although the depreciation of the rupee against the dollar and the jump in international crude oil prices helped OVL's revenues, profit after tax in 2011/12 was only 1.1 per cent higher than in the previous year. Its oil production fell eight per cent, and gas output, 5.7 per cent. In 2010/11, oil production had increased 0.6 per cent over the preceding year, and gas production, 13.98 per cent.Ajay Arora, partner at Ernst & Young who leads the oil and gas vertical, points out that most of OVL's ""troubleprone"" assets were acquired a decade ago, when no one could have foreseen how things would turn out. ""At that time, things were evaluated accordingly,"" says Arora. E&Y was the consultant for OVL's Sudan purchases in 2003. But it is not as if news of India's international oil and gas assets has all been good in past years. After acquiring a stake in Sakhalin-1 in Russia, OVL scoured West Asia and Africa, where it found itself pitted against China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and China National Offshore Oil Corporation. Heavily armed with cash and their government's support, the Chinese companies pipped Indian ones in battles in Angola, Bangladesh, Iraq, Myanmar, Nigeria and elsewhere.In Iran, Indian companies are caught in the crossfire between the international community and the regime in Tehran. The European Union and the US oppose Iran's nuclear programme, and companies and countries that deal with Iran could face sanctions. In the last three years, India has reduced oil imports from Iran and delayed exploration and production in the Farsi block, and Iran has threatened to scrap the deal. As the next step, the Indian consortium, consisting of OVL, IndianOil and Oil India, is legally bound to sign a development plan with National Iranian Oil Company, but is dawdling.""There is pressure from Iran,"" says a petroleum ministry official who asked not to be identified. A board member of one of the consortium companies says Indian companies see potential in Australia, Canada and the US. ""If we offend them here, our interests there could be harmed,"" he says. ""Hence we are adopting a wait-andwatch policy and negotiating with the Iranian government.""The official says that even if the consortium signs the plan, things will be delayed, as the sanctions on Iran make it tough to get equipment and raise capital. An official petroleum ministry spokesperson says: ""We have told the international community that we can't sever relations with Tehran, as we have historical links. But Iran needs to make the international community comfortable about its energy programmes.""OVL Managing Director D.K. Sarraf says his company is in touch with Tehran, but refuses to comment further. In South Sudan, OVL's investment in the Greater Nile Oil Project, in partnership with China's CNPC, was stymied as the breakaway nation - it gained independence from Sudan in July 2011 - halted production in June 2011.Foreign ministry officials say South Sudan suspects China of helping Sudan crush its freedom movement. Last year, until production was halted, this block had yielded OVL 2.5 million metric tonnes of oil. In April, the ministry sent Additional Secretary Amarendra Khatua as special envoy to the region to help restart production. The oil ministry official says a small amount of production has resumed, and that things will improve when diplomatic ties are established. South Sudan is oil-rich, but lacks refineries. Former petroleum minister Ram Naik points out that none of the Indian companies' problems arose overnight. ""One needs to factor in troubles in the foreign country where one has assets,"" he says.In Europe, OVL has a different type of problem. According to a March 2012 Comptroller and Auditor General report based on an audit of 20 of OVL's 45 assets for the period between April 2004 and March 2010, the company paid too much to acquire Imperial Energy in Russia. The report also noted that OVL overestimated Imperial's reserves and production potential, leading to a loss of `1,182 crore. The Central Vigilance Commission has initiated an inquiry into the deal.OVL had to make a $408 million provision for the next financial year for Imperial's poor show. Business Today made many unsuccessful attempts to contact R.S. Butola, who was managing director when the deal was struck. India is lobbying for tax breaks for exploration in Imperial's seven blocks in the Tomsk region. A foreign ministry official says: ""The Prime Minister on his last visit discussed this issue with the Russian establishment."" However, no headway has been made since.A consortium of Oil India Limited (OIL) and IndianOil is adrift, too - it has not made a single acquisition in three years. ""We have set aside Rs 6,000 crore for foreign acquisitions,"" says OIL Chairman S.K. Srivastava. ""We are in talks for two locations, and might close the deal soon."" In Egypt, Libya and Syria, political violence has forced Indian companies to abort operations. ""We have no option but to wait and watch developments,"" says an official spokesperson for the external affairs ministry.Since 2003, Indian oil companies have invested $100 million in Libya. OVL has surrendered its three blocks there, and OIL and IndianOil have said they cannot fulfil obligations in two of their three jointly operated blocks. After OVL invested more than half a billion dollars in Syria through ONGC Nile Ganga Corp - and got 0.8 million metric tonnes of crude out of it - the Syrian Petroleum Company, which operated the block, shut down production because of anti-government violence.Aashish Mehra, Global Partner and Managing Director of the India and Asia-Pacific practice at Strategic Decisions Group, believes risk evaluation should be more rigorous. ""OVL must partner with the right type of companies, and deal with more transparent and friendly regimes,"" he says.",https://www.businesstoday.in/magazine/features/story/overseas-problems-of-ongc-videsh-other-oil-companies-33665-2012-08-03,"India's overseas oil and gas exploration has been floundering for a while.

ONGC Videsh expressed interest for two oil and gas blocks up for offer

After having to abandon its oil and gas assets quest in Vietnam off the South China Sea India has asked ONGC Videsh Limited (OVL) not to go ahead with its acquisition of hydrocarbon assets located in deep water in Falkland Islands

The Ministry of External Affairs to the Petroleum and Natural Gas Ministry comes after OVL had sought clearance from the Ministry for making bids for two oil and gas blocks up for offer in the Falkland Islands which had been termed as attractive assets.

The OVL had got a farm-in offer from Falkland Oil and Gas Limited (FOGL) through its advisor Stellar Energy for divestment of up to 35% participating interest in two of its exploration acreages located offshore to the south of the Falkland Islands.

The opportunity was evaluated by OVL's technical team as well as Fugro Robertson Ltd (FRL), technical consultant engaged by OVL. Both the teams found the blocks attractive in terms of their large resources but also risky on account of being a frontier basin and the prevailing geo-political situation.

The blocks are located in the South and East Falkland basins in water depths ranging from 500 metres to 2,000 metres. There sources estimate of the prospects identified vary from nearly 7 bbl to 13 bbl of oil (for oil case) or 46-57 trillion cubic feet (tcf) for gas case.

Although a few wells drilled in the Northern offshore indicate presence of hydrocarbons, the offered Eastern and Southern acreage is ranked exploratory.

In view of the larger hydrocarbon potential and a number of leads and prospects in the acreage, the opportunity was found to be interesting for pursuing. OVL, represented by the Petroleum and Natural Gas Ministry, had approached the MEA for clearance to put in bids for these assets.

However, officials in the Petroleum Ministry said that the MEA had advised OVL against pursuing interests in the region due to the sovereignty claims and dispute between Britain and Argentina. It was also felt that OVL was seeking assets in virtually other end of the world while its recently acquired Imperial Energy in Russia had turned out to be a not so good opportunity.

OVL gave up drilling in Block 128 in Vietnam due to severe logistic constraints in anchoring the rig on a hard sea bottom at the proposed drilling location. OVL had acquired two offshore exploration blocks (127 and 128) in Vietnam as Operator with 100% Plunder Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs). A well was drilled in Block 127 in 2009 and no hydrocarbon was found. After fulfilment of PSC obligations, the block was relinquished.

Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas R. P. N. Singh had stated before the Indian Parliament recently that sovereignty over areas of the South China Sea was disputed between many countries in the region.

OVL is a subsidiary of India’s flagship oil company and has operations in Brazil, Colombia, Cuba and Venezuela

The overseas arm of Indian state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), ONGC Videsh Ltd is in talks to buy 25% stake in an exploration block off Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic, reports The Economic Times from New Delhi.

OVL is in talks to buy 25% stake of UK-listed Falkland Oil and Gas Ltd in two exploration blocks, lying 350 miles off the Southern tip of Argentina, sources privy to the development said.

FOGL, an oil and gas exploration company focused on its extensive licence areas to the South and East of the Falkland Islands will retain operator-ship of the licence.

The blocks are located in the south and east Falkland basins in water depths ranging from 500 meter to 2,000 meter. The resources estimate of 15 prospects identified may hold up to 15 billion barrels of oil equivalent or 46 Trillion cubic feet of gas reserves.

Under the terms being discussed with FOGL, OVL would contribute its pro-rata share of 2012 drilling program, comprising two exploration wells. OVL would also pay its pro-rata share of certain historical costs incurred during 2011 related to preparation for drilling this year. The costs incurred are estimated to be 68 million dollars.

Besides, OVL would make cash payment of 40 million dollars. If the Loligo prospect, where drilling is due this year, turns out to be a gas discovery, a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal would be built onshore with a capacity of about 7 million tons per annum for exports to consumption centres like India. But if the reserves are of lesser than quantity, a floating LNG project may be developed, they said.

FOGL plans to drill one exploration well (Loligo) in Phase-1 in the Northern License Area. In Southern Licence Area it has committed to drill one well by December 30, 2015. Under licence terms, a Discovery Area can be held for five years to allow time for appraisal drilling and submission of a development plan, sources said adding exploitation (production) period has been capped at 35 years.

According to its website, ONGC Videsh website was rechristened on 15th June 1989 from the erstwhile Hydrocarbons India Private Limited, which was incorporated on 5th March, 1965. Over a period of time, OVL has grown to become the second-largest E&P company in India both in terms of oil production and oil and gas reserve holdings. The primary business of OVL is to prospect for oil and gas acreages abroad including acquisition of oil and gas fields, exploration, development, production, transportation and export of oil and gas.

OVL is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd, ONGC), the flagship national oil company of India. It has operations in several Latin American countries: Brazil, Colombia, Cuba and Venezuela.

Starting with the exploration and development of the Rostam and Raksh oil fields in Iran and undertaking a service contract in Iraq, a major breakthrough was achieved by OVL in 1992 in Vietnam with the discovery of two major free gas fields, namely LanTay and LanDo, in partnership with British Petroleum and Petro-Vietnam.

The success carried on thereafter. In 2001, OVL acquired 20% stake in Sakhalin-1 project in the far east of Russia. In January 2009, OVL completed the acquisition of Imperial Energy Corporation Plc., an UK listed company, having its exploration and production assets in Tomsk region of Western Siberia, Russia with an investment of over 2.1 billion dollars.

OVL along with other consortium partners was selected in February, 2010 by Venezuela for awarding a 40% ownership (equity) interest in a “Mixed Company” which will develop the Carabobo 1 Norte and Carabobo 1 Centro blocks located in the Orinoco Heavy Oil Belt of Venezuela. This is a multi-billion integrated oil project in Venezuela.

Recently, OVL added one asset in its portfolio of exploratory assets by signing agreements with KazMunaiGas (KMG), the national oil company of Kazakhstan for acquisition of 25% participating interest in Satpayev exploration block on 16th April, 2011.

The company, adopting a balanced portfolio approach, maintains a combination of producing, discovered and exploration assets, working as operator in 11 projects and joint operator in 6 projects. OVL produces hydrocarbons from its 9 assets, namely, Russia (Sakhalin-I and Imperial), Syria (Al-Furat Project), Vietnam (Block 06.1), Colombia (Mansarover Energy Project), Sudan (Greater Nile Oil Project and Block 5A), Venezuela (San Cristobal Project) and Brazil (BC-10) ; Blocks A1 and A3 in Mayanmar, Carabobo-1 in Venezuela and Farsi Block, Iran have discover and further work is being carried out.

OVL international oil and gas operations produced 9.45 MMT of O+OEG in 2010-11 as against 0.252 MMT of O+OEG in 2002-03. OVL overseas cumulative investment has crossed 12 billion dollars.

Some of the leading alliance partners of OVL are BP, CNPC, Ecopetrol, ENI, Exxon, Statoil Hydro, PDVSA, Petrobras, Petronas, Petrovietnam, Repsol, Rosneft, Shell, Sinopec, Total and TPOC.

India was hoping that ONGC Videsh Ltd,the overseas arm of the state-run firm,will be able to ink the Exploration and Production Contract (EPC) for the Caspian Sea block at the meeting of the India-Kazakhstan Inter-Governmental Commission today but Kazakh side was not ready.

“The agreement is not being signed today,” a top official said.

Kazakhstan Oil and Gas Minister Sauat Mynbayev will lead the Caspian nation at the inter-governmental talks while the Indian side will be led by Petroleum Minister Murli Deora at the day long talks.

OVL is to invest about USD 400 million in the prospective Satpayev oilfield in the Caspian Sea.

Satpayev is situated in highly prospective region of North Caspian Sea and is in proximity to at least four fields.

A peak output of 287,000 barrels per day (14.3 million tonnes a year) is envisaged from the 256 million tonnes of reserves in the field.

Kazakh national oil firm KazMunaiGas will be the operator of the field,holding remaining 75 per cent stake.

The official said initial agreement for OVL and its partner Mittal Investment Sarl (holding firm of steel magnate Lakhsmi Mittal) getting 25 per cent stake in the Satpayev was signed during Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev’s state visit in January 2009 and a EPC has been under discussion since then.

But in November 2009,Mittal pulled out of the project and OVL decided to take the entire 25 per cent stake on its own.

He said OVL will pay USD 26 million as signing amount to the Kazakhstan government.

Besides,it will also pay USD 80 million as one-time assignment fee.

On top of this,OVL has committed a minimum exploration investment of USD 165 million and an additional optional expenditure of USD 235 million.

The 1,582 sq km Satpayev block,situated in the Pre-Caspian Basin of Kazakhstan,holds 1.75 billion barrel of inplace oil reserves.

It lies in proximity to major fields like Karazhanbas,Kalamkas,Kashagan and Donga,where significant amounts of oil has been discovered.

The Sakhalin venture,The Sakhalin venture,"Production starts at the Shakalin-1 oilfield in far-eastern Russia, where India has made its single largest investment abroad.

OCTOBER 1 was an important day for ONGC Videsh Limited (OVL) in its quest to achieve energy security for India. It was on that day that its managing director R.S. Butola and Exxon Neftegas president Steve Terni, turned on a valve on an oil platform at Chayvo Bay, signalling the start of the production of crude oil from the Sakhalin-1 field in far-eastern Russia. India has invested $2.77 billion in the hydrocarbon project, its single largest investment abroad. Of the 23,000 barrels of oil and 58 million cubic feet of gas produced a day in Sakhalin, India will get 20 per cent, a quantity in proportion to its equity.

The total recoverable reserves from the Sakhalin-1 field alone are estimated at 2.3 billion barrels of oil (307 million tonnes) and 17.1 trillion cubic feet of gas (485 billion cubic metres). Subir Raha, Chairman and Managing Director, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), said: ""At full capacity, we should be getting about 2.5 million tonnes of oil every year.""

Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Mani Shankar Aiyar, who was present at Chayvo Bay on October 1, said: ""It is not usual for a company from a developing nation to be associated with such a project."" He described Sakhalin-I as ""the beginning of a much longer and deeper association with the island on the east coast of Russia."" Viktor Borisovich Khristenko, Russian Minister for Industry and Energy, who had pushed for India's participation in the project, said it marked a new beginning in the relationship between India and Russia. He said, ""We have an excellent relationship [with India]. We have cooperation not only in the oil and gas sector but also in other spheres like defence... We are natural allies.""

The product from Sakhalin-1 project is sweet crude, similar to the Nigerian crude. It is bonny light and lends itself easily to being refined into petrol, diesel and kerosene. The ONGC has not yet firmed up its plans on how to use its share of crude oil from Sakhalin-1 - whether to sell it abroad, swap it with another country's crude or transport it to India. Indications are that the ONGC would bring the oil to its subsidiary, Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited (MRPL), Karnataka, for refining. ""This will maximise our profit,"" an ONGC official said. OVL's share of production from the Greater Nile Oil Project in Sudan is being refined at the MRPL from 2003. The participants in the Sakhalin-1 consortium have signed agreements to sell natural gas from its offshore field to two buyers in Khabarovsk Krai, Russia.

In the early part of the 20th century, geologists and geophysicists exiled from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics discovered several oilfields, including Somotlor, the biggest hydrocarbon-bearing field in Siberia. Sakhalin Island, situated in the Sea of Okhotsk, was ""the zone of penal servitude and exile"" in the 19th century. It had been a bone of contention among the Russians, the Japanese and the Chinese since the 15th century. The trouble started when the Japanese settlers on Hokkaido, headed by the Matsumae clan, grabbed the region. There were several expeditions from China, Holland and Portugal to Sakhalin, which was thought to be a land of gold and silver. The battles and expeditions came to an end when Russia ""completed the annexation of the region on January 2, 1947"".

The island, with its inhospitable weather (snow-bound during winter), is today the largest oil hub in the Pacific Ocean. According to Pallab Bhattacharya, deputy general manager, corporate communications, ONGC, it is also ""the most vibrant place with unending flow of capital"". The importance of Sakhalin can be understood from the fact that there are weekly flights from Anchorage, Houston and Tokyo from mid-August.

""A dedicated oil pipeline and terminal facility at DeKastri on the Russian mainland will export crude oil to world markets beginning early 2006. Full production is targeted for the end of 2006. The initial gas production will be sold in the Russian Far East domestic market of Khabarovsk Krai... The Odoptu and Arkutun-Dagi fields will be developed in subsequent phases,"" the web site adds.

When Union Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha visited Moscow on January 15, 2001, it was clear that India and Russia were on the verge of concluding the Sakhalin agreement. On February 10, 2001, the representatives of OVL and the Russian-owned Rosneft company signed an agreement in the presence of Ram Naik, who was Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas at the time, and Khristenko, who was Russian Deputy Prime Minister. OVL was to invest $1.7 billion in the project. Ram Naik described the agreement as ""a quantum jump in Indo-Russian economic relations... In the context of Indo-Russian relations, the Sakhalin-1 project will be remembered years from now same way as we remember the Bhilai Steel Plant.""

Oil industry sources said the Sakhalin-1 contract was signed only after the direct intervention of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who spoke to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Putin reportedly insisted that India should buy 20 per cent equity from Rosneft, which originally held a 40 per cent equity. The sources said that Russia had suggested that OVL hold 20 per cent equity, extract oil until it recovered its entire cost of production and then turn over the 20 per cent to Rosneft. The Russian government was not keen on concluding the agreement until India agreed to this. India, however, did not want to return OVL's share to Rosneft. The contract was signed only after Putin directly took up the matter with Vajpayee, the sources said.

The Union government approved OVL's additional investment of $1.07 billion in the Sakhalin-1 project on November 24, 2004, only after Russia agreed to India's condition that OVL should be allowed to retain its equity. An official press release on that day said, ""The additional investment in the project will help in acquiring equity oil abroad and help in increasing oil security for the country.""

SAKHALIN-1 is OVL's second overseas project to begin hydrocarbon production. Its first project to go on stream was in Vietnam. On December 18, 2002, OVL started delivering gas from the Lay Tay gas field, off the coast of Vietnam, to utilities inland for electricity generation. The Lan Do field also started producing gas a month later. When OVL acquired 25 per cent equity in the Greater Nile Oil Project in Sudan, it was already an oil producing property. OVL literature says that the Greater Nile Oil Project is an onshore crude oil production area, covering 50,000 sq km, in southern Sudan in the Muglad Basin, about 700 km southwest of Khartoum. For the financial year ending March 31, 2005, OVL's share of production from this project was about 26.82 million barrels of crude oil. This oil is brought to MRPL for refining. When the production from the Greater Nile Oil Project peaks, OVL's share could reach 25 million to 27 million barrels a year.

OVL was set up to provide energy security for the country by sourcing equity and gas from abroad. For while the ONGC's indigenous production of crude oil stands at 26.48 million tonnes, the country's demand is 120 million tonnes of crude a year. OVL is trying to bridge this massive gap.

According to ONGC Reports of August, its official publication, OVL has shown ""spectacular performance"" in recent years. It has established a strong foothold in hydrocarbon-potential areas spread over 15 properties in 13 countries, including the Ivory Coast and Australia. Its investment commitment overseas stands at $4.3 billion, of which about 64 per cent has been invested up to March 31. This makes OVL the biggest Indian multinational corporation.",https://frontline.thehindu.com/the-nation/article30206985.ece,"Production starts at the Shakalin-1 oilfield in far-eastern Russia, where

Indian OVL to garner $850 m from oil investment in Sudan,Indian OVL to garner $850 m from oil investment in Sudan,"The Telegraph, India

New Delhi, March 13: ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) is expected to rake in around $850 million during the current financial year from its share in the Greater Nile oilfield in Sudan.



OVL expects to get around 3.3 million tonnes of crude this year as its share in the Greater Nile oilfield and, like all other companies, has to pay a corporate tax on its profits.

The 25 per cent stake in the field was acquired for $670 million and another $160.4 million has been spent on developing it.

The sweet crude from the oilfield is considered as the same quality as Nigeria’s Bonny Light variety. “The average price could conservatively work out to around $46 per barrel for the year,” a senior company official told The Telegraph.

According to petroleum ministry sources, OVL’s share in the balance proven oil reserves of the Greater Nile project works out to around 20.4 million tonnes. However, this figure could go up as the field is developed further.

An ONGC official said, “It is quite common to upgrade the reserves of good oilfields as they are developed further and more oil is found in-place. This happened in the case of Mumbai High as well.”

The joint operating company, which includes the Chinese national oil company and Malaysian national company Petronas, is expected to invest another $350 million for further exploration and development of the Greater Nile project during 2005-09. OVL will have to foot 25 per cent of this cost, which works out to $87.5 million.

Having established its credentials through the Greater Nile project, OVL has gone on to acquire a 24.1 per cent interest in exploration block 5A and a 23.5 per cent share in block 5B in Sudan. The Indian company has paid $135 million for the two blocks and spent another $13 million on exploration and development since then.

Some oil has already been discovered in block 5A and OVL’s share at this stage has been estimated at 5.9 million tonnes.

The calculated risk that OVL took in moving into the strife-torn Sudan – after the Canadian company, Talisman, pulled out due to pressure from orthodox church groups – appears to have paid off.
