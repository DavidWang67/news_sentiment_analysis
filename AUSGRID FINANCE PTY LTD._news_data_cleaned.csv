Cyber attack on Ausgrid could lead to costs of $2.9bn per day,Cyber attack on Ausgrid could lead to costs of $2.9bn per day,"Cyber attack on Ausgrid could lead to costs of $2.9bn per day

Australia’s largest east coast electricity provider has revealed the staggering potential cost of a cyber attack in a submission to the Cyber Security Expert Advisory Board.

In its response to the board’s 2023–30 Australian Cyber Security Strategy: Legislative Reforms Consultation Paper, Ausgrid has said a cyber attack on its systems could cost upwards of $2.9 billion each day that services are disrupted.

“Ausgrid operates a shared electricity network that powers the homes and businesses of more than 4 million Australians living and working in an area that covers over 22,000 square kilometres from the Sydney CBD to the Upper Hunter,” Murray Chandler, Ausgrid’s head of network strategy and future grid, said in the submission, before going into detail on the potential impact of a cyber attack.

============ ============

“As the most populous network area and financial capital of Australia, over 20 per cent of Australia’s GDP is generated within our network area.

“We supply energy to 105 hospitals, Australia’s only radiopharmaceuticals production facility, four of the world‘s top 200 ranking universities, three major ports and 37 per cent of Australia’s financial services industry. This means that a cyber attack on our network, even for a few hours, would severely disrupt lives and livelihoods.”

According to Ausgrid, the cost of an attack that causes a “complete shutdown of our infrastructure” could cost more than $2.9 billion each day, or $120 million per hour of disruption.

“We support the board’s ambitions for Australia to become the most cyber secure nation in the world by 2030 and broadly support the consultation paper,” Chandler said.

Ausgrid’s support may be broad, but the rest of its submission did contain some specific points of contention.

For instance, when it comes to mandatory ransomware reporting, “Ausgrid supports the $10 million per year threshold for mandatory reporting. However, Ausgrid sees merit in lower threshold voluntary reporting so that the government can release case studies and alerts about incidents that impact smaller entities.”

Similarly, Ausgrid does support a 72-hour initial reporting window for ransomware attacks but also notes that detailed reporting is another case entirely.

“We do not recommend a time frame for detailed reporting as it will depend on the complexity of the incident and will need to be agreed upon between relevant parties based on the circumstances,” Ausgrid said.",https://www.cyberdaily.au/security/10588-cyber-attack-on-ausgrid-could-lead-to-costs-of-2-9-billion-per-day,"Ausgrid reveals potential cost of a cyber attack in response to 2023–30

Local bond issuers turn to US private placements,Local bond issuers turn to US private placements,"According to Valladares, Australian issuers with long-term assets are a great match for the US investor base. Given US private placement investors are looking for creditor and geographic diversification, Australia offers a resilient economy matched with a strong regulatory and governance regime which is appealing, particularly in the utilities sector, she says.

One Australian utility which has issued into the USPP market this year is Ausgrid. The company raised over $1.48 billion across four currency pairings and multiple tranches, making it one of the top five foreign US private placement transactions in 2023[2].

“The size of the Ausgrid transaction moved the needle for utilities,” Valladares says.

Michael Bradburn, chief financial officer at Ausgrid.

Ausgrid chief financial officer Michael Bradburn says the USPP market is stable and reliable – which made it a good option for issuance against the backdrop of rising rates and the uncertainty around inflation. Importantly, Ausgrid was an attractive proposition for US investors who are “generally very keen to support Australian companies, especially a regulated utility and repeat issuer like ourselves.”

Facing a sizeable refinancing task, Ausgrid had the challenge of finding a market that would be able to support a strong volume and pricing outcome when the issuer was ready to execute following an extended amendment process, says group treasurer, Ed Waters. “The USPP market is attractive because of its reliability across the cycle and the option to diversify across different tenors meaning we could spread a large volume of issuance across more than one tenor and significantly reduce future refinancing risk,” Waters says.

“This allowed us to blend multiple tenors together ranging from seven to 15 years, creating greater access to capital and an overall larger transaction size. Ausgrid’s distribution network has an important role to play in supporting the NSW’s energy transition and the funding certainty of the USPP market makes it a reliable core issuance market.“

Ed Waters, group treasurer at Ausgrid.

“We were also assisted by CBA as one of three – lead placement agents on the transaction. CBA was very well co-ordinated between relationship and the product teams offshore and onshore. Being under the one roof and the co-ordination between teams was a core part of delivering such a strong and well balanced, price competitive outcome,” Waters says.

CBA’s executive director, real estate and infrastructure, future cities and networks Scott Young, says “In the context of Ausgrid, they will continue to participate in bank and debt capital market issuance into the foreseeable future and it’s expected they’ll be a prominent issuer in various markets in Australia and around the globe.”

Bearing this in mind, Young says CBA works strategically with Ausgrid well in advance of any transaction coming to market.

“We’re continually refining and assisting Ausgrid to better understand their funding needs and being proactive. Working closely with clients is one of the core tenets of what CBA seeks to do.”

Another local company tapping the USPP market this year was AGL Energy, which sought funding to support its role in the nation’s energy transition.

“What we fundamentally like about the USPP market is the tenor,” says AGL’s general manager of capital markets and corporate development, Stephen Brown. “It provides a longer tenor debt product that helps us better balance the treasury book to achieve our diversification goals across tenor, markets and structures.”

Stephen Brown, AGL’s general manager of capital markets and corporate development.

Brown said the CBA team were especially helpful in managing investors and walking them through where Australia is at in its energy transition.

“Bringing that local market knowledge and helping provide that to the US investors enabled us to have more productive conversations and was probably a key value add,” Brown says.

“There are certain States in the US, including California, who are about where we are in the energy transition, but there are some states that are behind. It was interesting seeing a diversity of views from investors on how they’re addressing the transition and from our perspective, really talking about how we are managing, leaning into and delivering on Australia’s energy transition.”

As for CBA’s broader role in the USPP market, the bank provides an end-to-end service supporting Australian and New Zealand corporate issuers. Companies such as Ausgrid and AGL have turned to CBA for risk management solutions including cross currency swaps to convert issuance proceeds into the desired currency and protect against future movements in foreign exchange and interest rates. A key feature of the USPP market is the flexibility it can provide issuers to obtain funding from investors across a range of maturities and currencies on the same transaction.

“Our focus is to work closely with each client to streamline and manage what can be a very intricate swap execution process. Establishing trust and confidence in this aspect of the deal allows our clients to concentrate on all the other competing, time-sensitive priorities supporting the transaction to reach a successful conclusion”, says CBA’s managing director of client risk solutions, Hope Gatis.

"Poles and wires super-profits causing energy price spikes, and foreign 
takeovers","Poles and wires super-profits causing energy price spikes, and foreign 
takeovers","A hidden super-profit being levied by network providers is costing Australians a billion dollars a year. Callum Foote reveals new research on the “gold-plating” rip-off which has made this country a haven for foreign billionaires and has enticed financial engineers from Brookfield into splashing $30bn in network takeovers.

When you don’t pay tax, you can afford to pay more in a corporate takeover. That’s Brookfield’s magic. Not a cent in income tax paid by Brookfield’s BPIH on $16bn in total income over 8 years.

The tax haven specialists are now pouncing on Origin Energy in a binding $18.7 billion takeover just a year after snapping up Victorian energy transmitter Ausnet for just shy of $10bn. They had a crack at AGL too. Like Hong Kong billionaires Michael Kadoorie (EnergyAustralia) and Li-ka-Shing (Spark and CKI) they know Australia’s regulators are ripe for gaming. They know super-profits are on the corporate menu for over-charging Australian consumers.

New research from Simon Orme at IEEFA (below) identifies the profiteers, but first, will the Brookfield and EIG takeover for Origin succeed, will it diminish competition?

Possibly not, according to the experts.

Bruce Mountain, Director of Victoria Energy Policy Centre at Victoria University says that “I presume that the ACCC will require strict legal separation of Ausnet from Bookfield’s retail and generation businesses.”

Nod and a wink?

Regarding whether the deal is likely to go ahead, Mountain says that “I presume they have been given the nod on this by the ACCC or they would not have progressed to this point.”

Mountain points to state governments that own generation, retail and network businesses as a model for Brookfield’s planned endeavour. “There is a precedent for this” Mountain says “the Tasmania and Queensland governments own generation, retail and networks.”

Mountain believes that even if it were inclined to do so, the ACCC will have a tough time deciding against the takeover: “I imagine with the precedent, it would have been hard for ACCC to push back.”

Over the last 8 years Brookfield, under its Australian subsidiary BPIH Pty Ltd, has produced $15.8 billion in revenue and not paid a single cent in corporate income tax.

The deal is yet to get its stamp of approval from the ACCC as well as the Foreign Investment Review Board, which is something of a rubber stamp. However, other energy experts say that monopolistic network providers are already levying over a billion dollars in super profits from Australian customers annually.

Prices to rise anyway

Many may not realise it, but east coast governments set a ceiling on energy prices. Called the default market offer in NSW, South East Queensland and South Australia, and the Victoria Default Offer in Victoria, these offers are made to ensure competition underneath the set price.

Energy market expert, Simon Orme says that “Both the Australian Energy Regulator and the Victorian regulator have price comparison sites. Customers can go to this price comparison site and determine whether their current provider is offering lower than the default price.”

Power bills for households in Queensland, NSW and South Australia will rise as much as 23.7% from 1 July if the Australian Energy Regulator’s draft determination, announced on Wednesday, is confirmed. Prices in Victoria may rise by almost a third.

While the majority of the increase in the default offer is a result of rising energy costs resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, excessive network costs charged by providers account for up to a third of the increase.

A report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis finds that 15–33% of energy bill rises could be avoided if private monopoly electricity networks were no longer allowed to extract supernormal profits.

How the super profits are gassed up

Energy network providers are natural monopolies because it is not efficient to build multiple electricity networks alongside one another.

To ensure that the networks do not exert monopoly pricing power, the AER regulates the prices that these networks charge consumers.

The total cost that networks can recover from consumers is the “regulated revenue”.

The AER sets the “regulated revenue” based on forecasts of the cost of transmitting energy to customers provided by the companies themselves.

Regulated revenue is expected to “to cover the costs of investing in, building, maintaining and operating the networks, plus a reasonable profit to ensure compensation for investors,” says report author Simon Orme.

Gold plating the networks

However, Orme has found that these companies have consistently misrepresented how expensive these factors are by up to a third in some cases.

“AER and the network businesses overestimated the costs that network businesses would require to build, operate and maintain the network. Networks charged those overestimated costs to consumers, and shareholders retained the differences between revenues and costs” Orme says.

The most costly overestimation is financing costs, which Orme says account for half of the super-profits being earned by network businesses.

“Most network businesses are charging consumers significantly more than required to achieve their normal return and pocketing the difference in the form of additional returns” says Orme “However, the AER has decided to let this practice continue for another five years.”

Worst offenders: Ausgrid, Endeavour, Origin

In NSW, which has a new incoming government, supernormal network profits are being extracted in privately owned Endeavour and Ausgrid network areas. This contrasts with publicly owned Essential Energy serving regional NSW where returns are adequate but no more than adequate.

IEEFA’s analysis found that Origin Energy’s subsidiary Endeavour Energy, which services Greater Western Sydney, the Blue Mountains, the Southern Highlands and the Illawarra region charges a 21.1% super-profit on its customers.

Endeavour Energy was formed when the NSW government sold its network to Origin in 2011.

By contrast, Essential Energy, an NSW Government-owned corporation that services rural NSW and parts of southern Queensland, charges no super-profits whatsoever actually taking a 1% haircut on return on investment according to Orme’s analysis.

Another offender is Ausgrid, again formed in 2011 when the NSW sold off its network assets.

Ausgrid, owned in a joint venture between the NSW government and AustralianSuper and IMF investors charges a 9.1% super-profit on the power bills of 1.8 million customers.

Super profits for Hong Kong billionaires too

SAPN, or South Australian Power Networks, sold by the South Australian government to controlling shareholder Hong Kong-based Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings, and Australian investment fund Spark Infrastructure charges a 15.5% super-profit to its customers.

On average, excluding publicly owned Essential Energy, network providers are earning a 13-14% super-profit across the east coast and South Australia.

With NSW Labor in power, Orme says that “This is the perfect time for state governments to make changes that families will appreciate by reducing power price rises.

Deal: A large syndicate of Australian and international banks have been advised in connection with the refinancing of Ausgrid’s senior bank facilities.

Value: $1.53 billion

Area: Banking, projects

Key players: The Gilbert + Tobin team was led by banking and projects partner John Schembri, with support from lawyers Erin Cartledge, Mark Nichol and Yuka Nagata.

Deal significance: Ausgrid is the largest distributor of electricity on Australia’s east coast, servicing 1.7 million customers in Sydney, the Hunter and the Central Coast.

As per a statement from Gilbert + Tobin, the transaction, which involved the establishment of a new common terms deed platform and the renegotiation of terms applying to an additional $3.18 billion of senior bank facilities, “demonstrates Ausgrid’s ability to achieve highly competitive financing terms while diversifying the maturity profile of its senior bank facilities”.

“It was a privilege to advise a sophisticated group of local and international lenders on the refinancing and amendment of Ausgrid’s senior bank facilities,” said lead partner John Schembri.

“This transaction demonstrates that recent volatility in the debt markets has not impacted lender appetite for supporting and investing in quality infrastructure assets, as evidenced by the strength of Ausgrid’s banking relationships.

How two 'crisis points' nearly undid Ausgrid's SAP Ariba overhaul,How two 'crisis points' nearly undid Ausgrid's SAP Ariba overhaul,"Two major predicaments nearly derailed Ausgrid’s overhaul of its procurement processes, but the energy giant managed to get the project back on track to meet its go-live deadline, if not its budget.

Until last year, Ausgrid was running much of its procurement activities through largely manual processes and “poor systems”, according to its head of procurement Guy Ferrier.

In some cases it could take up to two or three weeks to get approvals for purchase orders. Finance staff were spending up to a third of their time journaling, rectifying errors and tracking down incorrect information, while as an ex-government organisation, its policies and procedures were lengthy.

Project managers also had no visibility of what was happening with work orders in their remit; this was a realisation Ausgrid came to very publicly in 2015 when the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) found an engineer had pocketed more than $300,000 from contractors bidding for work.

While the company - already an SAP shop - is now settling into its new SAP Ariba procurement platform, it was no means an easy journey to the June go-live.

“It was not plain sailing. There were two real crisis points in our project, and I can’t tell you how much pain just thinking about them now causes me,” Ferrier told an SAP Ariba conference in Sydney this week.

Problem one: the blueprint. It had been designed by Ausgrid's IT team with “the best will in the world”, Ferrier said, but it was made clear fairly quickly that it wasn’t the right fit.

“This was going to the heart [of the business]. Every single group [internally] seems to have its own way of doing things,” he said.

“Getting that all summarised in the IT team’s blueprint was a challenge and it was clear we had these warring parties.

“So we had to put in place an extremely strong project director and give them a whip and a chair. It cost us eight weeks initially, and we also had to rebudget. It was a very very significant increase.”

Problem two: the departure. The project director that Ausgrid had put so much reliance on walked into Ferrier’s office five months out from go-live and announced they were quitting because the project was going to fail.

“‘Blind Freddy can see you’re simply not going to make this work because you’re not bringing people along’ she said. And the point was, she was right,” Ferrier said.

“Because even though we’d recovered from the blueprint, we were spending too much time on the science of it, and not on the people.”

For a platform that would touch 4000 people - 600 of them heavy users - managing 22,000 purchase orders and 200,000 invoices per year across 19,000 suppliers and four spending divisions, Ausgrid couldn’t afford to not have its staff on board.

After “a lot of soul searching”, almost half of the project team was removed and a different tack taken to change management.

“A number of extremely strong change people working with our business process lead created a bit of a quirky, fun culture - I know it irritated a few engineers initially but once they got over it they realised this was a different culture, and there was less defensiveness.”

The new focus on change management identified 650 people within the organisation that were having trouble with the transition to a new approach to procurement, and used everything from workshops to one-on-one sessions to get them on board.

“This [crisis] cost us another five weeks and a project manager, but it was absolutely worth it,” Ferrier said.

In the red

Ausgrid went live with its new SAP Ariba platform on June 6 after a “false start in March” and more than little bit over budget.

“We actually closed the project on time once we had the second pass approval. With about 12 months to go we got the date right and held it,” Ferrier said.

“We didn’t have to go back to the board for another walk of shame, we managed to get the dollars right that second time, but it was a significant increase on what we were initially led to believe.""

He declined to provide figures but attributed the budget rise partially to integration challenges - Ausgrid wound up with 19 more interfaces than it initially thought - but said it was mostly due to a lack of clarity from the start.

“It was everything. We were told a story that just wasn’t right in many aspects.”

Having come out the other side of its challenging procurement overhaul, Ausgrid is now benefiting from a significant reduction in requisitioning time, full visibility of project spending, an internal brand improvement for the procurement team, and better supplier relationships.

“Requisitioning used to take a week, sometimes two weeks - now we have a third of all requisitions done in a day, and 25 percent done in an hour. It’s an astonishing change,” Ferrier said.

“[There’s also been] a big enhancement in the supplier relationship space because they can see Ausgrid is making an effort to become a responsible accounts payable procurement function. And it is translating itself into dollars in negotiations.”

The biggest learning to come out of the experience was not to downplay the importance of staff being brought into any business process transformation, Ferrier said.

“Don’t overdo the science side of things, but do fully invest in the art of bringing people along on the journey. I can’t tell you how [important] the art side of this was.”

bureaucracy

the EP&A Act and related policies

case law

other environment and planning processes

Bureaucratic changes impacting councils

Changes to the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act and related policies

the introduction of pre-development application consultation between neighbours

integration of the new Sydney Planning Panels (which have replaced Joint Regional Planning Panels (JRPPs) within Sydney) into the EP&A Act, and setting out the new role of the Panels as consent authorities

an end to transitional arrangements for projects approved under Part 3A, including modifications

A new VPA Practice Note dealing with ""value capture"", the practices of councils entering VPAs and the appropriateness of using VPAs in certain circumstances. It attempts to strike a balance between legitimate efforts to ""capture"" development profits and illegitimate ""revenue raising"", in light of mounting evidence that VPAs were being used by some councils as a ""ransom"".

A new pre-Gateway review process allowing reviews (by the Panels) of planning proposals that have stagnated. This is an important change necessary to reduce blockages in the system. We are currently acting on a number of proponent-led planning proposals impacted by a lack of inertia, which ironically seems partly attributable to the amalgamation of councils. It remains to be seen whether these blockages will be smoothed out with this review process.

The introduction of District Plans – these plans appear to be an attempt to bring NSW back to what some see as the planning utopia that existed with the Cumberland Planning Scheme in the 1950s. These plans provide a policy link between the state and regional-level strategic planning and local controls in LEPs, and will help inform the 2017 review of A Plan for Growing Sydney (Greater Sydney's regional plan). District Plans also contain matters for consideration relevant to development applications or rezonings.

Further SEPP refinement and consolidation (with six SEPPs being repealed) and changes to SEPP 44 relating to koala habitat protection to broaden the scope of land that falls within the core koala habitat area.

The replacement of JRPPs with Sydney Planning Panels (SPPs). The SPPs determine regionally significant development applications (generally development with a capital investment value of more than $20 million) within the Greater Sydney Region (as defined in the GSC Act), and consider rezoning reviews. These are the same functions previously performed by the former Sydney East and Sydney West JRPPs.

Significant planning and environment cases

R v Turnbull murder case

Compulsory acquisition cases before the Land and Environment Court

Cases dealing with commencement and lapses of development consents



1. The following questions need to be answered affirmatively in order for the development consent not to lapse:

Is there a development consent for the erection of a building or the carrying out of a work?

Will the work relate to the approved development?

Will the work be commenced on the land to which the development consent applies before the lapse date?

Changes to other environment and planning legislation and processes

A new Container Deposit Scheme commencing in July 2017 that will reduce the strain on councils' obligations for waste collection. Under the scheme, anyone who returns an empty eligible beverage container to an approved NSW collection depot or reverse vending machine will be eligible for a 10-cent refund. A network of depots and reverse vending machines will open across NSW to receive the empty containers.

Proposed amendments to the Protection of the Environment Operations (Waste) Regulation 2014 to repeal the ""proximity principle"". This change will place an obligation on occupiers of levy-liable waste facilities who wish to claim a transported waste deduction to provide evidence of the lawfulness of the receiving facility to use the waste for the relevant purpose.

A new Coastal Management Act 2016 that will have a significant impact on development within the ""coastal environment area"" which is expansively defined to include land adjoining coastal waters, estuaries, coastal lakes and coastal lagoons.

coastal waters, estuaries, coastal lakes and coastal lagoons. A new Crown Land Management Act 2016. Crown land comprises 50% of land within NSW and often has high ecological importance. The new Act provides, among other things, for:

(i) Ministerial powers to require Crown land managers to take environmental and heritage considerations into account in making decisions about Crown land

(ii) community engagement in decisions about Crown land by requiring the preparation of a community engagement strategy for proposals that could affect public use of Crown land

(iii) Councils managing Crown reserves being required to follow detailed community engagement provisions under the Local Government Act

(iv) enabling the most appropriate local owner of Crown land to engage in negotiations during the process to transfer land out of the Crown Estate thereby providing for involvement for Aboriginal communities in Crown land and managing Crown land with native title rights and interests

(v) greater powers to stop illegal activity on Crown land

Strata law reforms under the Strata Schemes Development Act 2015 allowing developers to carry out ""renewals"" where 75% of lot owners in a strata scheme vote to support the strata renewal plan. This has also created appeal rights for owners to the Land and Environment Court to challenge the compensation they receive for these forced private acquisitions. We have started to see a run on these matters. The provisions form a new mechanism for enabling urban redevelopment with increased density.

Changes to the Land Acquisition (Just Terms Compensation) Act 1991 and the processes to be followed for councils in acquiring land. These changes: impose longer time frames for the pre-acquisition process; the potential for reinstatement to be compensated; and increase the amount paid for what was previously known as solatium (increased from $25,000 to $75,000). We mention this change as planning for the infrastructure required to support NSW’s projected population increases will inevitably require more compulsory acquisitions.

The introduction of the new Biodiversity Conservation Act and repeal of various other laws (e.g. Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995, Native Vegetation Act, and parts of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974), including a Biodiversity Offsets Scheme. The changes include: requiring the preparation of a biodiversity development assessment report for development approvals if the activity is likely to significantly affect threatened species; and introducing a new biodiversity offsetting scheme (replacing biobanking) to create biodiversity credits which can then be transferred (meaning sold) or retired (meaning they cannot be sold).

There has never been so much incremental reform impacting development in NSW as there is today. All this at a time of big crane counts, big infrastructure and a need to increase housing supply. We take a look at the key changes in 2016 to bureaucracy, the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (the EP&A Act), case law and other environment and planning processes.While the NSW coalition mantra of ""evolution not revolution"" has been recited as the pragmatic underpinning for the latest reform agenda (in pointed contrast to the 2013 wholesale proposed-but-unsuccessful reform of the EP&A Act, the cumulative impact of each reform is beginning to feel more revolutionary than evolutionary. The upshot is that significant change is happening faster than you can say “Have your say”, in order to facilitate, among other things, the “new normal”; annual population increases of 30,000 people each year in NSW.In this context, this article provides a high level summary of some of the key changes during 2016 to:At the macro level, the amalgamation process for many councils is still being resolved in the courts. As the below Jade Precedent Tracker visually demonstrates, the courts have heard a large cluster of cases challenging the amalgamations.We mention this because the coalface of planning and environment issues is often at this tier of government. During what appears to be somewhat of a “caretaker” period (the period when councils are under administration and before a new elected council is installed), councils are meant to be complying with the Department’s Circular No 16-18/ 27 June 2016 / A489192 Council decision-making prior to the September 2016 local government elections . Although it is not a binding policy, we have observed difficulties in its implementation and even soft enforcement. Despite this, the circular is an important policy if NSW truly wants to “make things happen” given the current flux in local government. This is particularly important given the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics data showing a fall in approvals over the last six months. While correlation does not prove causation, the reduction in approvals does coincide with the amalgamation of councils in NSW.We have also just witnessed (and will continue to see) changes to the Local Government Act 1993 of both a symbolic and substantive nature, including the replacement of the charter with principles. While some of these reforms are geared at removing red tape, work will inevitably be required to ensure compliance and implementation of the new requirements or options available. Councils will need to adjust to some of the more permissive regulation embodied in the Act.One of the key environment and planning changes is the absence from the principles of the requirement for councils, councillors and council employees to have regard to the principles of ecological sustainable development (ESD) in carrying out their responsibilities and its removal from the principles for local government.Of course, many of the Acts under which local government works, such as the EP&A Act, still require consideration of ESD principles. Accordingly, the removal of ESD in the Local Government Act amendments is likely to have more of a symbolic effect.The other major change to the bureaucracy dealing with environmental planning issues is to the Department of Planning and the creation of the Greater Sydney Commission (GSC) through the Greater Sydney Commission Act 2015 . The significant change here is the introduction of the GSC which came into effect on 27 January 2016. Many of the Minister’s functions have been delegated to the GSC. This is particularly relevant for planning proposals. The GSC has also been tasked with some important planning functions such as the creation of District Plans, discussed in more detail below.Finally, the enforcement capabilities of the Department of Planning have been ramped up (see its Ministerial media release Toughest fines in the country come into force ) across the Sydney, Singleton, Wollongong and Queanbeyan offices - doubling the number of compliance officers in the field across NSW to monitor and enforce the conditions placed on developments of state significance.We recently attended an end of year seminar from Carolyn McNally, Secretary of the Department of Planning, who mentioned that a more comprehensive Planning Bill was on her desk. While we wait for that to eventuate, some of the changes gazetted in 2016 address:Other reforms include:The Supreme Court issued its sentencing decision involving a lengthy custodial sentence of 35 years in R v Turnbull (No. 26) [2016] NSWSC 847 , for the murder of an environmental officer while exercising his public functions investigating native vegetation clearance. While not strictly an environmental law case, this decision marks the conclusion of a two-year trial, preceded by investigations into allegations of unlawful clearance of native vegetation for the purpose of converting two properties to broadacre farms. It also provides some background to the repeal of the Native Vegetation Act 2003 and the introduction of the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016 The Land and Environment Court has had a busy year dealing with the number of compulsory acquisitions going on within NSW. Judgments in Dial a Dump Industries Pty Ltd v RMS [2016] NSWLEC 39 , and in (the long-awaited) RMS v Allandale Blue Metal Pty Ltd [2016] NSWCA 7 were handed down. Both cases have helped clarify the types of interests that are compensable when an interest in land is compulsorily acquired. Bligh Consulting Pty Ltd v Ausgrid [2016] NSWLEC 75 also provides some useful analysis on the approach to valuing construction easements that are compulsorily acquired, although the matter is under appeal. Reysson Pty Limited v Roads and Maritime Services (No 4) [2016] NSWLEC 159 was perhaps one of the most novel compulsory acquisition appeals in 2016. The case involved an appeal against the amount of compensation offered by the RMS for the compulsory acquisition of land at Banora Point in far north New South Wales. The primary hearing was conducted in November 2012. Due to the age-barred imposition on judges at retirement age, the sitting Judge in that matter was unable to hand down judgment on a weekday before leaving the bench . Accordingly, the decision in favour of RMS was handed down to the parties and their legal representatives on Sunday 5 June 2016 at about 4.30 pm via teleconference – the day before Justice Craig’s 72nd birthday. In these proceedings, the applicant submitted that the judgment and orders should be set aside because of the procedural irregularities observed by the Court in handing down its primary decision. The Court rejected these arguments, but interestingly did not award costs given the compulsory acquisition context and due to the novel nature of the issues and the reasonableness of the arguments put.There have also been a number of cases that have cleared the air on physical commencement and lapses of development consents, which has been a recurring theme for us this year with numerous owners and purchasers requesting advice on this issue. The three key take home points from these cases are:(Kunc J in Macquarie International Health Clinic Pty Ltd v Sydney Local Health District; Sydney Local Health District v Macquarie Health Corporation Ltd; Macquarie International Health Clinic Pty Ltd v City of Sydney Council (No 9) [2016] NSWSC 155 at [69])2. It is well established that survey and geotechnical works can constitute “engineering work” for the purposes of section 95(4) of the EP&A Act ( Benedict Industries Pty Ltd v Minister for Planning; Liverpool City Council v Moorebank Recyclers Pty Ltd [2016] NSWLEC 122 per Robson J (at [59]).3. But the answer on these matters, as Tobias JA acknowledged in Hunter Development Brokerage Pty Ltd v Cessnock City Council; Tovedale Pty Ltd v Shoalhaven City Council [2005] NSWCA 169 (at [86]), that these cases turn on questions of ""fact and degree"" – shows that each case needs to be considered in light of the statute and case law that have emerged.The EDO’s case for Millers Point Fund Inc v Lendlease Millers Point Pty Ltd & Others was also heard in November 2016, regarding a challenge to decisions by the NSW Planning Assessment Commission (PAC) on the Crown Casino development at Barangaroo. It will be interesting to see what results from this case in terms of the PAC's obligation to assess modifications of the development's proposed location.There have also been a myriad of other reforms but too many to substantively deal with each one. So in the spirit of 2016, we set out in “listicle” form a summary of the other changes that have occurred:The key things to watch out for in 2017:",https://www.cbp.com.au/insights/insights/2016/december/planning-and-environment-a-recap-of-2016-and-what,"There has never been so much incremental reform impacting development in
